This call is being recorded. If you do not wish to be recorded, please disconnect at this time. Welcome to First Energy. Speaking of the Tisha, how can I help you? Hey, my property is going to get the connection today. I was wondering if everything's okay from your end in terms of connecting the power to my property. Are you in Victoria? I'm in Victoria. I mean, yeah, I'm in Victoria. Yeah. Okay. So normally I work from Victoria as they do at any time between nine to five. What's your mobile? Bring up your details. 0401. Yes. 667983. Yeah. And can I confirm your full name, address and date of birth, please? My current residential address is 11A Attenborough Square. That's in Montana. Date of birth is 8th of November, 1986. Yeah. And can I confirm the full street name, suburb, state and postcode? So you can bring up your details. Okay. So it's 11A Attenborough Square and Montana 3152. Now, did you sign up with a company called Hood? Yeah, I did. Yeah. Yeah. Someone's actually cancelled the order. Okay. Right. Okay. I probably will reach out to those Hood guys and sort it out then. No, no, no, no. Don't call them because I can probably get it connected in the next couple of hours urgently. Because what happens, they just go through a different website and then they call us. Okay. Ah, there you go. I've actually found out what the issue was. Do you have a middle? How do you spell your name? Because I think someone might have made a mistake. How do you spell your first name? K-U-N-D-A-N. And the middle name? I don't have a middle name. Okay. And your surname? Ramiseti. R-A-M-I-S-E-T-I. Yeah. Stay there. What I'm going to do, I'll do the credit check myself and I'll get it done later on today. You're lucky you've called, you know, because they've actually... Yeah. Because one of your colleagues actually gave me a call and said that because I don't have an Australian passport or any sort of identity, she couldn't verify me. So she said that she will give me a call back. But she never did. Probably she just cancelled it. Yeah, sorry. We get customers all the time from overseas. So give me a moment. I'll do the quick credit check now. And if you pass, we'll just sign you up. Yeah, sure. Won't take long. Okay, yeah. Thank you. Do you know, has the main switch been turned off? I have no idea. I'm flying in today. So tomorrow I will be having the keys. Yeah. Okay, don't worry. I'll put the order through for today anyway. So if anything goes wrong, I'll keep an eye on it and I can tell you. So stay there. Yeah. Okay. And also, I think it's electricity and the gas as well. Has the gas been cancelled as well? Yeah, I'll get them both sorted. Don't worry. Okay, sweet. Awesome. Thanks, mate. Cheers. What I'll do is I'll just do the credit check and then I'll send you a text with everything filled in. You tick a few boxes, send it back to me and it's all done. Okay, perfect. Awesome. Thank you. Yeah. No, it's okay. No, lucky you called me, though. Yeah, I'll look for your text, eh? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. No, you stay there. I'll stay online. Yeah. Are you flying in tomorrow, yeah? No, I'm flying in today. So I'll be there tonight. But yeah, I will be going. I will be taking the keys and will be getting into the property tomorrow. Now, give me a moment. It's showing us on the system, it's showing us unit 111. Is that correct? Yeah, that's right. I mean, it's funny how they named it. It's unit one in some places. It's 11A in some places. So yeah, it's unit one. Yeah. Oh, cool. Yeah. Just wanted to make sure I didn't want you paying someone else's bill. That's awesome. Thanks. Okay. Yeah, no, that's all good. So what happened was, the property owner, Robert, requested a meter works. At Toomba Square. And then we had to exchange the meter as well. Obviously, we couldn't just do that on Robert's advice. We had to speak to you. Ah, that's fine. You've passed our credit check. So stay there and I'll sign you up again. I'll send you a text message. I'll stand in line with you. I'll get it done in two seconds. And I'll get a push for you urgently for you. So just remember, for the guests, just carry on using it. They won't be coming until Wednesday or Thursday to take a reading. Okay. Okay. So it doesn't have to be urgent, because I know that if you put in an urgent request, I have to pay like a surcharge or something, right? No, not in Victoria. Not with the smart meter. Oh, okay. Okay, that's fine. As long as there is no extra surcharge for that. Okay. Let me just check for you to make sure. Okay. I'll do the electricity first. Yeah, so how it works is they time do the connection remotely, okay? Okay. And in Victoria, most of the times they can. So if it's done remotely, then there's no cost to you. Okay. Oh, okay. Yeah. So let me just check. That's correct. That's for turning it into two-phase power, yeah. So that's got nothing to do with the meter after I've done it. The smart meter is the electricity that's charged to do the two-phase work that's going to be up. Are there solar panels on the roofs in there? No, there is no solar panels, no. Excellent. If you can post your information and you can just check it all, then I'll send you the guest one separately. Okay. Now I'll keep an eye on your order. Any issues, I'll just send you an email. Okay, 7401, 667983. Hold on, I'll do it. Wow. 7401, 667983. Can I just quickly confirm your email address? It's my first name, Kundan. Yes. Do you want me to spell it out for you? I've got it here on the screen. Okay. So it's kundan.r. Yes. at iCloud.com. We've got a different one on file. I better change it. We've got your Gmail. Actually, sorry, don't do that. Just keep the Gmail one if you have it already. Yeah, cool. Just keep the Gmail one because I have created an account on your portal as well. Yeah, cool. Can I just quickly confirm your passport number? My passport number? Yes. It's LM379844. Yeah, cool. And what country was it issued in? New Zealand. Yeah. And the expiry date, please. Hang on. Sorry, I just know that by heart. But my computer is expiring. One second. No, it's okay. Hang on a sec. So the expiry is on 8th of December, 2027. Do you have any other property, any kind of life support equipment like a sleep apnea machine or a breathing machine? No, no. Excellent. Let me just bring up the fees so you know what they are. And you don't have a concession card, do you? No, we don't, no. Can you please check your phone, Kunden? I'll just send you one for the electricity and then I'll do the gas. Okay, so as I said, if it can be done remotely today, then there's no cost. Only if something happens and they can't do it remotely, then they charge $39.89. That's only if they can't do it remotely. So take your time, and I'll do the gas one separately for you. Okay, sweet. So you'll get a link that's got my name on it. I have got a link. Yeah, so touch the link. And put your date of birth and full and postcode and then press submit. Okay. Yeah, and I'll talk you through it. And just when you get to one page, you'll say, are you moving or are you changing retailers? Just leave it that you're changing retailers when you see that. The reason being is if you put moving, we'll put in like Wednesday's date, if you're putting changing retailers, I can grab the order and get it done urgently for you today. Okay, so I've put my date of birth and I've put the postcode and it says invalid data entry. What's your date of birth? 8th of November, 1986. Ah, okay, give me a moment. I think I've made a mistake. Delete that one. Okay. I'll send you another one. That's almost done. I'll make sure it's done correctly. I think I've made a mistake. That was me. Yeah, but I sent you the first one. Okay. Okay, cool. So as you can see, that bill there. 8th of November, 1986, is that right? Yeah, 8th of November, 1986, yeah. So that's a normal postcode. That goes to the second page. That's from... Yeah, that's not far. Next. 4166793. I'll do the gas one first. Gas. Passport. I'm going to fix the electricity one up, so in the meantime, I will just send you the gas one. Gas one. Just carry on using it. You're not going to be charged until Thursday for the gas. They have to come out and do what's called a special reading, okay? Right. Okay. That one. Try that one, then I'll do the gas. Now the gas, it's multi-nit, so they just have a very small fee of $7.95 to take the meter reading on Thursday. So this one opening okay? Yeah, this one's fine. So I'm going to the gas one now. Thank you. So first day of the class. Okay, all good. The details are correct. Thanks. The property address is correct. Moving date, as you said, you put it as 18th, right? Which is okay. No, no, no, no. Oh yeah, that's the gas. That's right. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So it says I'm moving and I'm moving date is 18th of May 2023, which is all good. Property address looks good. Yeah. And then the identification passport all looks good. Thanks. Is anyone at your property on life support? No. Do you have a concession card? No. Okay, cool. So that's all looking good. So I'm going to hit create my account. You're nearly there. I think you have to read and click some boxes and click create my account. Otherwise, it'll just go around in circles. Yeah, that's right. I guess I got that now. Thanks. Accepting all of those. You're nearly there anyway. Yeah. Okay, cool. Done. Oh, okay. You're fast. Let me do the electricity. You're faster than me. Stay there. I'm just copying and pasting information from your other account. Okay, check your email now. There will be the electricity one and then this one. I just need you to change it to your changing retailers. Okay, one second. So I haven't got the email yet. I probably checked the spam as well. Oh, no, it's a text message. Sorry. I think. Okay. Yeah. Okay. You got a text message or no? Okay. Yeah, I did get a text message. Second one should be a second one for me. Yep. Cool. Yeah, same thing. But on this one for the electricity, don't put your moving and put your changing retailers and that doesn't create more than I'll push it through manually for you today. Okay, great. Okay. So electricity, fast saver and all my details look correct. Thanks. Property address looks all good. Oh, you said I'm changing retailers? Yeah, then I'll grab it from here and I'll get a push through this afternoon for you. I'll keep an eye on it. Okay, cool. Yeah. My passport details is good. Life support information. Yep. Okay. I will go accept these things. Cool. So I'll create my account. Yep. All done. I can see it on my screen. Thank you. Yeah, so the gas, don't worry about it. And electricity, I'll get it done for you later on today. Okay. Thanks for your call. No, I'm good. Awesome. Thank you. Have a good day. Thanks. Bye. Thanks a lot.
