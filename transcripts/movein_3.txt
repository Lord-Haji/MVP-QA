This call is being recorded. If you do not wish to be recorded, please disconnect at this time. Welcome to Thirst Energy. You're speaking with Annika. How can I help today? Annika, how are you today? Good, thanks. How can I help today? I have an account with you and I wish to reopen an account. I had on another property with you. Okay, not a problem. Let me find your existing account. Is it linked to the phone number you've just called off? Or did you have another number? Probably. Yep, I didn't have anything loaded up with this mobile. What was your other phone number that would be on the account? Or if you have a customer number. I don't have one handy. I can give you my name. Yep. Stuart Wale, W-H-A-L-E. And was it Stuart spelled S-T-U-A-R-T? There is. Oh, there we go. I've got something loading up. Yep, two accounts there for me. Perfect. Yep, and can I just get you to say your date of birth and one of the addresses that you have with us already? Yeah, 250149, 74 Walter Street, Bridport, TAS 7262. Perfect. And now you just want to add another address. Yeah, which I had previously with you. It's Atkinsfield, 1849 Bridport Road. Let's have a look. 1849, oh, there we go. So that one was closed. Yeah, that's someone transferred it. They went with Energy Local or something. Oh, okay. And this one, does it have any solar panels? No. Nope, no problem. So 1849 Bridport Road, Bridport. Perfect. Yeah, we could transfer this back over to us. There's no lock-in contracts, no transfer fees. We'll place you on our First Plus offer. And the way it works is you receive $100 worth of bonus credits over 12 months. So you get a $50 credit on your 6 and 12 monthly bills. And in order to set it up, I just have to read through some scripts, which are the terms and conditions. And then just confirm all the details we have. Well, this is a rental property and there's no one there just at the moment. The power is being disconnected today, I believe. Now, when the new tenant comes, which could be any time, can it be transferred into his name without fees? Yeah, just get him to give us a call. So you mentioned that the power is going to be disconnected today at this property? I believe so. Oh, OK. That means we'll actually have to book it in as a connection. So we have to book it in as of tomorrow. Actually, let me just check if we can do tomorrow. It should be OK. But there is a fee of $93.19, including GST, which will be on the first bill for this property. And yeah, we can start it in your name as of tomorrow. If we can transfer it before it gets disconnected, is it possible to waive that fee? Unfortunately, we can't do that. So I assume the bills were already in your name with another retailer, but are the bills in the previous person's name that was living there? Yes, that's correct. Yeah. So we're going to have to just book in a new meter reading or connection. And unfortunately, with that, the fee can't be avoided. So $93.19. Even if it's a smart meter? Yeah, even if it's a smart meter. So yeah. And then tomorrow is the earliest we can do it. So the 16th of May. Right. Yeah. So if the previous bill hadn't been cancelled, is it possible just to transfer names with you? The fee would still be applicable. So then it'll just be a meter reading. OK. Not just a new connection, but it's the same fee, whether it's a meter reading or connecting the actual service. Right. Yep, yep, yep, yep. Why do they charge a meter reading fee when it's a smart meter? It's classified as a move-in fee. So yeah. Basically, they do a meter reading, whether it's remotely or... They actually still go to the property, even if it's a smart meter. So they will actually go there, do whatever they need to do. And then the bills start in your name as of that day. They still go to the property? Correct, yeah. So if my tenant comes in two weeks, is he going to have to pay another connection fee? As of whatever day... To be put to the new connection? Yeah. So as of whatever day he wants it to start in his name, it'll be the same fee that's applicable, unless he's going to be moving in. It'll be the same fee that's applicable, unless he wants to take over as of tomorrow's date, so the 16th of May. But yeah, he will still have to pay the fee. Yeah. It used to be that if I waited... I think when I disconnected it, if I waited until the payment date, then there was no fee. Does that still apply? No. So I think you would have confused it with... so for example, if let's just say in a few weeks' time, you need to disconnect it out of your name, the disconnection fee is the same of $93.19. But if you have someone that's connecting it on the same day or a day before, it saves you from paying the disconnection fee. But the moving fee, unfortunately, can't be avoided. Right, yeah. Even if it's on a billing date? Even if it is, correct. Yeah, right. Yep. So any day is as good as any other day. There's no special day that the fees are waived? Correct. Because I think when I disconnected it before, I was told that if we do it, if we transfer it on the billing date, then there is no fee? It can't be done, unfortunately. Like, the fee is still applicable. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yep. Okay. So, yeah, is there any better deals you can offer me than $100 every year? Because it's probably only going to be in my home for a short time. Yep. The only alternative is our solar bonus offer, but that's not applicable for this property given that there's no solar panels. Are you a member with the RACP by any chance? I am a member. You are? Perfect. So in that case, we can place you on our RACT saver offer where instead of the bonus credit, you get a 6% guaranteed discount off the usage, and that's off each bill. So whether you're with us for one month, two months, or however long. Okay. That sounds good, doesn't it? Better, yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, we can do that. Yep. Perfect. So happy to proceed. Yeah. What's the next step? Proceed? What are the going rates in terms of daily and... Yeah, so including GST, the daily supply charge is $1.16 per day. The any time usage, which is tariff 31, is $0.2728, and tariff 41 is $0.1771. That's hot water, isn't it? Yep, heat and then hot water. Yep. Right, yep. So $1.16 and $0.27. Yes, $0.27287, correct. And then you get 6% off those usage charges on the offer. Right, yep. Yeah, I'm just thinking Energy Local is only charging about $0.90 a day. And the rates are $0.255, so it seems a little bit cheaper, but they do have a monthly account fee. So the $0.25 per kilowatt, is that with GST or without? I'm not sure. Most likely without GST, because if you add GST on top, so 10%, it's around $0.27. Yeah. Yeah. So... Yeah. So from... No, I think... I think because you're not charging a monthly fee and because you can give me 6% and because I can transfer it into someone else's name free of charge, like for me. Yep. Is that correct? Yeah, as long as they set it up in their name, then yeah, you don't have to pay any disconnection fees or anything like that. Yep, cool. Yeah, I think that's the way to go. Because they want $0.93 each, no matter what, no matter when, no matter who. So, well, I think I'll go with $0.25. Yeah, okay. Yeah, no problem. Now, for the RACT Saver offer, I will just need your RACT membership number. So do you have that on you? I think it's in the car. Hopefully. Yeah, well, I'll go through the scripting and then... or if you want to go get it first, either or. Yep, I'm on my way. Perfect, yep. If you want to go through the scripting, I'll just need your RACT number. Perfect, yep. If you want, I can go through the scripting. And that applies to my other existing account as well? The other one I think I saw was on the solar bonus offer. So you can only get one offer, whether it's the solar bonus or the discount. You can't get both offers. Okay, what's the solar bonus offer about? Just for interest. Yeah, you receive a higher solar feeding rate, whereas on the RACT offer, it's just the standard feeding rate. And then you get a 6% discount off usage. Yeah. What is the feeding rate for either of those, please? Yeah, let me just check. On our latest solar bonus offer, it's 10 cents is the total. Whereas, let me just make sure... So I'm just bringing up the old accounts. Yeah, you're on the old solar bonus offer, which is 13.88 cents. Whereas our latest solar bonus offer is 10 cents. And then the standard feeding rate is 8.88 cents, which is what you'd receive if you wanted the RACT saver offer. I'd recommend leaving it as is on the solar bonus offer. Yeah. Yeah. Did you say 13 cents? 13.88, correct. Yeah, good, isn't it? I've got a member number. Oh, yes, perfect. One second. Let me just go back. And yeah, what was the membership number? 1760453. 1760453. Yeah. Perfect. Now, I'm just going to have to read through some scripts, and then I'll confirm your details. We have our up-to-date. So I'll go through. You're speaking with Annika from First Energy on the future. You're speaking with Annika from First Energy on the 15th of May, 23. This call has been recorded for quality and compliance purposes. And before you proceed, can you confirm, do you have any type of medical equipment at your property for life support? No. And the address that we're connecting is 1849, Bridport Road, Bridport 7262. Is this correct? Yep. Yep. And based on the information you provided and our assessment, we can offer you the RACT Saver product. All amounts quoted are inclusive of GST. The key terms and conditions of our RACT Saver product is a market retail contract with a minimum 12-month benefit period, no fixed term, and no exit fees for the supply of electricity with First Energy, which comes with a 6% guaranteed discount off the usage. Now, would you like to hear all the rates? Are you happy for them to be sent in the welcome pack? All of them. That's fine, yeah. I think they're all about the same, the rates. Yeah, the ones that I just read out. Your data is a bit higher, I suppose. So what's 6% off $1.16? About $0.08, $0.07, isn't it? Yeah. All right. There's no discount on that, is there? There's no discount on the supply. It's just on the usage charges. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cool. Perfect. So I'll send them out. Yeah, we'll go that way. Perfect. I'll send them out to you. And would you like to receive your bills and other communications from First Energy via email or post? Email. And do you prefer monthly or quarterly billing? Monthly, probably better. Yeah. At this point, yeah. Yeah. So First Energy will send you a monthly electricity bill via email and send you any notices and communications electronically. And because we are billing you monthly, when no actual read is available, we'll estimate your electricity bill. Your initial estimated bills will be based on the average usage by a comparable customer, and then by using the average energy usage based on your previous actual reads. If we calculate your estimated bills to be too high or too low, this will automatically be adjusted on your next bill after we receive an actual read for your meter. So if it's a standard meter, we'll start the estimate. Yeah, it's going to be very minimal because we're not going to be able to see the actual read because no one's living there. Yeah, that's okay. So if it's a standard meter, we'll start the estimates at $100 monthly. But in your situation, if it's a smart meter, it's going to be actual reads, so it won't be estimates. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, would you like to proceed with entering into a contract with First Energy as your new energy retailer? And understand this is not a request for information only. Yes or no? The contract is totally open. Stop any time. Great. It's a no locking contract. Anytime you sign up to Energy, you're always entering a contract. So it's basically just asking, do you understand that you're setting up an account with us and this isn't just a quote? Yep, yep. Perfect. So I'll just ask again. Would you like to proceed with entering into a contract with First Energy as your new energy retailer? And understand this is not a request for information only. Yes or no? Yes. And I'll just confirm your details. So your name was spelled S-T-U-A-R-T, surname W-H-A-L-E, date of birth 25th of January, 1949, and email S-S-S-W-H-A-L-E at hotmail.com and mobile 0480288528. And is your home phone? Can you do it, Gavin? Sorry, one second. I'll just confirm these details. Is your home phone 03-63-560250? Not applicable. Get rid of it. OK, delete it. No problem. Now the postal address, do you want it the same as that address or do you want it at 74 Walter? 74. Yep, so Bridport. Oh, on the bill it will still be notified, won't it? Yes, it'll have the service address. So just postal address. Yeah, yeah. Do you want it as a 74 Walter, Bridport 7262? Why do you even need a postal address if we're emailing? We have to have a postal address on the account. We can't not have one on there. OK, yep. Yep, so happy with that one? Perfect. And, oh sorry, just a yes or no with that one, sorry, just to confirm? Yes. Perfect. And do you hold any concession cards? No. That's OK. And I do just need a form of ID, so driver's license number or Medicare card number with expiry. Yep, driver's license is E29841. E29841? Yep. And the expiry is January 27. January 27, and what day in January? Oh God, I've got to go back to the car. I think it's the 27th. 27th of January? OK. Yeah. And was it a Tassie license, just to confirm? Yes. Yes. Perfect, that's fine.
