This call is being recorded. If you do not wish to be recorded, please disconnect at this time. First Energy, speaking for Tish, how can I help you? Yeah, Tish, John Blakeworth speaking. Look, a couple of things. A gentleman was called Sirish, I think it was, was supposed to ring me back a couple of days ago. He didn't. One of the things he said, though, was, I knew it anyway, was the actual tariffs by time during the day and weekend. And I'd like to know what they are. And secondly, he said that my plan was outdated and I needed a new plan. So can you help me with that? What's your account number? Bring up your details. 179583. Yeah, let's have a look. Yeah, I'll just quickly ID you and we'll get it sorted. Can I confirm your full name, address and date of birth there, please? Yeah, John Stuart Blakemore, Unit 238, 50 McLaughlin Avenue, Darlinghurst, 2010. Date of birth, 24th of November 1939. Yeah, thank you. And what state are you in, please? New South Wales. Excellent. I'll just bring up your current plan. Yeah, this guy called Sirish, I think it was, a few days ago. He said that the plan was out of date. Yeah, it is an old plan. Now, do you have a concession card? Yeah, I'm a pensioner. How long have you had the concession card? Two and a half months. Okay, give me a moment. I just noticed something. Oh, two and a half months. I'm looking on your last bill. I can't see the concession discount. No, I didn't know I'd got that. I didn't know I was able to get one, to be quite honest. Oh, cool. I can see it is on the system, just to make sure that it was there. Cool. So what I'm going to do is, I've got your current plan in front of me. I'm going to bring up the other plan, and I'll do a comparison side by side. And if the other plan works out cheaper, we'll put you onto it. Stay there. Thank you. Okay. All the panels on the roof. Where's my calculator? I'll just get my calculator and work it out for you to make sure. Okay, thank you. Oh, no, there is a big difference. Cool. So currently you're paying, I think, 90.60 cents for the peak, and with the discount, you're paying 70 cents. On the new plan, it drops down to 47.234. Right, that's peak, is it? Yeah. So I've got the rates here if you want. Yeah, just give them to me. Yeah, with the discount, you'll see the peak is now going to be 47.234 cents a kilowatt hour. Yep. Off peak, 18.497 cents a kilowatt hour. Right. And the shoulder is now going to be 22.99 cents a kilowatt hour. Yep. And your supply charge is $1.044 cents a day. $1.046 per day. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So what I'm going to do now, John, a couple of things. When we change customers' plans, we just need a bit of a scripting. So what I'm going to do, I'll read the scripting, then I'll just verify some details like your card and ID, and I'll get a plan changed, and I'll get it emailed out to you in the next 24. Hang on. I should have asked you. Everything's posted out to you, isn't it? Sorry. No, I'd like it by email. I've got one by post office box now. The computer box, the email one is closed. Okay, give me a moment. I'll just check on my system. I'm just trying to save money, mate. No, I've got it on there. See there, residential. Oh, no, the address is showing as 238-15 McLaughlin. So cool. Now what I'm going to do is someone has not changed it, so can I get your email address, please? Yeah, mascjohn at iCloud.com. Oh. So m for Mary, a for Arthur, s for Sierra, c for Charlie, John. Yes, that's right, john, yes. At iCloud.com? Yes, that's right. Excellent, yeah. I'll get it sent out in the next 24 hours as well. And you can just put it next to your last bill when I send you the wild contact, and you'll see there's a big difference on the rates. Okay. If you're okay, can I start reading a scripting out to you? Yeah, sure. Oh, yeah, thank you. So I'm going to change all the bills now by email, not to the PO box, correct? Yes, good, thank you. When I read the scripting, I'll confirm that with you as well. Bear with me. Okay. I just bring up the scripting. We have different scripting for different states, so I don't want to give you the Victorian scripting. It's longer, so stay there. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, we deal with all the states, so they all have different scripting, and I've been quite out before, so I've read the wrong scripting, so stay there. 2010. Yeah, and medium, residential, and here's your bill. You've got peak. Okay, you've got time of use. Excellent. So can I start reading the scripting out to you now? Yeah, go ahead. Thank you. Yeah, about five minutes. Now, like I said, my name's Satish from First Energy. Just letting you know, this call has been recorded for quality and compliance services. Before we proceed, can you confirm, do you have any type of medical equipment at your property for life support? No. Excellent. And now, John, we can keep you on the first saver product. Based on information you provided in our assessment, all amounts quoted are inclusive of GST. We can offer you the first saver product, which is equal to the reference price, with an additional 5% discount off the reference price if you always pay on time. The estimated minimum annual spend for ANEM is $1,424. This estimated cost is rounded to the nearest dollar and is based on average residential usage of 3,900 kilowatt hours and the time of use tariff in the Osgoode network area. Your bill will differ based on your actual usage. Now, the key terms and conditions of our first saver product is a micro retail contract with ongoing benefits, no fixed term and no exit fee, full supply of electricity with First Energy. That's for the NMI 410 376 58687 for the address of Unit 238 50 McLaughlin Ave, Darlinghurst, New South Wales 2010. Now, let me bring up the plan, which comes with a 5% pay on time discount on all your electricity usage charges and the supply charges as well. So you get the 5% when you pay on time off both the rates and the supply charge. A basic plan information document containing the rates and key details of this plan is available to send to you upon your request. Remember to receive your payout time discount, you must pay your bill in full by 5pm on a due date. Now, once again, John, would you like to hear your rates now? Yeah, yeah, go ahead. Yeah, OK. So, all including GSC and discount, the supply charge is going to be $1.044 cents a day. Yep. Peak 47.234 cents a kilowatt hour. Right. Off peak 18.497 cents a kilowatt hour. Off peak was 18.49. Yep, and the shoulder 22.990 cents. Right. Now, I also advise you, your rates will be sent out in confirmation of this offer to you, so I'll get them sent out to you. Now, I need a clear yes or no on this question, and I'll get it changed for you. You'd better tell me when the peak hours are, for example. What are the hours of the day? I'll get that to you later, but I have to read the scripting out. If I make a mistake on the scripting, I'll call you back tomorrow and read the whole thing out. But let me finish reading the scripting, then I've already got that on another screen. We'll do that one now. OK, go ahead. Yeah, thanks. So, I need a clear yes or no. Would you like to proceed with amending your existing market resale contract with First Energy, and understand this is not a request for information only? Yes. Thank you. And can you just please confirm, is there any type of medical equipment at your property for life support? No, there's not. OK. And you've given me your new email address. Let me just check that. Let me go back into the system. You gave it to me. I'll just have to read it all out to you. mascjohn at iCloud.com. Is that correct? Yes, mascjohn at iCloud.com. Yeah. OK. First Energy will send you a monthly bill via email, and send you any notices and communications electronically. Do you provide your consent to receive electronic communications? Yes, I do. Thank you. Now, earlier you mentioned you have a concession card. So what I'll do, John, just got to double check on our system to make sure. Can I confirm the CRN number that's printed on the card, please? Yeah, yeah. I'll just have to get it. Just one moment. Take a second. Yeah, take your time. Sorry, John. I'm sorry. I should have asked you as well. Can I just get your driver's license as well? Yeah, yeah. I've got it here. Yeah. CRN number first. We'll go over that one first. Yeah. Let me go to my system. CRN 211. Yes. OK. So, you've got the number. Yeah. I've got it here. I've got it here. Yeah. I've got it here. I've got it here. Yeah. I've got it here. Yeah. I've got it here. Yeah. I've got it here. Yeah. I've got it here. I've got it here. Yeah. Excellent. That's what I'm looking for. Yes. 441? Yes. 081A. Awesome. What's the start date? Issue date? 14th of April, 2023. Thank you. And just the expiry date, please. The expiry date is 30th of November 2024. Yeah, awesome. Just hang on. I'll take this. The priority date is 30th of November, 2024. Just hang on, I'll take the call back for a minute. Just hang on a sec, can you take, can I take? Sorry, are you there still? Yep. Sorry about that. Okay, can I confirm your driver's license number please? Oh yes, of course. It's 1287HG, I know that went off by heart, but I'll just check that I haven't... 12? 1287HG. Yep. Yeah, that's right, I just got it. And expiry date please? 17th of August, 2024. And is it a New South Wales license? Yeah, New South Wales, that's correct. Awesome, give me a moment. So thanks for confirming all that. Cool, so thanks for confirming the details. I'll just have to read a small script about your concession and it's all done. Thanks for confirming your card number. Because you have a concession card, I will now play for you an important statement about you providing consent for First Energy to confirm your concession card agility. With regards to your concession, you authorise First Energy to use Centrelink confirmation e-services to perform an enquiry of your Centrelink or Department of Veterans Affairs customer details and concession card status to enable the business to determine if you qualify for a concession, rebate or service. The Australian Government Department of Human Services to provide the results of an enquiry to First Energy. You understand that the department will disclose personal information to First Energy, including your name, address, payment type, payment status and concession card type and status to confirm your agility for your concession or rebate. This consent remains valid while your customer is First Energy unless you withdraw it by contacting First Energy or the department. So like I said, this consent remains valid while your customer is First Energy unless you withdraw it by contacting First Energy or the department. You can get proof of your circumstances and details from the department and provide it to First Energy so your agility for your concession can be determined. If you withdraw your consent or do not alternatively provide proof of your circumstances and details, you may not be eligible for the concession to be provided by First Energy. So basically, what that means is we just get your card checked with Centrelink, but I can see on the system it has been verified anyway, so don't worry. Okay. Yeah, cool. Let's have a look. License number, New South Wales. That's annoying. It's not taking your card number. Now, one thing I need to advise you of is for the times, it's quite tricky, so give me two minutes. I'll stay on the phone with you. I'm going to send you an email to give you a breakdown, but they have different times. They have eight or ten different times, so stay there. I'll send you the email now. So I'm talking to you, but I'll get your email and I'll double check it for you so you know. Okay. Okay. Let's have a look. One, two, eight, seven, N, H, G, N, S, 78, 24. Okay, so you are in, what is it, Osgrid? Okay, Osgrid, Osgrid, they have different rates. South Australia, where is Osgrid? New South Wales. New South Wales. Osgrid, time of use. Okay, now I thought there were three different times of use, so I have to make sure I put you on the right. There's different times, so let me check yours. Okay. If I don't send you the wrong email, then you'll start using the app at the wrong time, so stay there. Okay, E1, TOU, E1, TOU, E1, POS, POS, DEMAND. Osgrid, yeah, okay, I've got it, stay there. I just want to stay on the phone with you to make sure you get it the moment you're calling back again, because you've probably waited to stay there. It'll be coming from internal sales, so stay there. I'll send to you right now. Great. Try again, copy. Control V. Ah, okay, it's worked, okay. I'll just put here time of use times, so you'll see it in the heading, and I'll just put your email address and you just tell me if you've got it. Okay. Okay, I'll send it to you. It's working. I'm going to, there's one big blob, I'm going to bullet point it for you so you can see it in different columns, otherwise it's too hard to read. Okay, residential. Cool. Check your email now. There should be something from me, and just tell me if you've got it. Thanks. Just one moment. Just one moment. That's okay. Check the junk in the same folder as well, just in case. Okay, yes I've got it. Yeah, it's going to be for each column, so just keep that somewhere or maybe print that out or something. I've changed your plan. I'm changing it now. Can you just check in the next 24 hours when you get it, John, and make sure that the rates match what I've told you, so sometimes those packs can have mistakes. But it's all been changed for you. You watch a big quarter of the savings. All done. Thank you very much. You've been very helpful. Thank you. That's okay, you have a good afternoon. Thank you. Thank you, bye bye. Don't worry. Thanks. Bye bye. Bye bye.
