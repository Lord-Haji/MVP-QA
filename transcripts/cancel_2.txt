I actually am current, I'm holding like a current service for First Energy. I'm actually wanting to cancel the disconnection that was actually requested for today at my property because due to unforeseen circumstances, I will just have to stay in the property for a few more days. Okay, give me one moment. Let me have a look. Now, just to let you know, calls are recorded for quality and compliance purposes before we proceed. And just for the security of the account, Samayda, can you confirm your full name, address and date of birth, please? Yep, so that's Samayda Deenbaran and my date of birth is 30th of August 1995 and my address is 4 slash 217 Tulosa Street, Pinokhi, Hoi Baat. Alright, thanks. 7010. 7010, sorry. Oh, give me one moment. Okay, give me one moment. Okay, so you are not moving out anymore? Yeah, because we've had some issues with the real estate, so we're not moving out as yet. Okay, because I'm just checking here. Another retailer has, so because if you're not moving out, the new tenants who were supposed to move in are not moving in anymore, correct as well? No, yeah, because they were the new owners, so the settlement, actually it has been pushed back. Well, I think because they requested, because I think you called us earlier as well, the new owners have requested for the new connections on the same date where you requested for the move out. So I think because they signed up with the new provider, so I think they went with Aurora. Yeah, they mentioned that they will be going ahead with Aurora. Yeah, you need to tell them to cancel that request with Aurora. Okay, well if... Because if that goes ahead, then from 16th, they will be the new, everything will be under their name from 16th of this month. Okay, that's okay. Look, we'll leave that as it is for now, then we'll cancel the disconnection if that's okay. Yeah, that was automatically cancelled when the new electricity company requested for the connection. Yeah, so you will be building until 15th and then if they have signed up from 16th, then they take over from 16th officially. Okay, that's perfectly fine. Yeah, no worries because we've had some issues with them. So yeah, so initially it was meant to be 15th or the 16th, moving out and moving in. However, I was just kind of stayed at the property for a bit longer. Yeah, no problem. That's perfectly fine. I'll call them and advise them if that's the case for you. Anyway, it's going to be from the 16th that they've asked for a connection, isn't it? Yeah, correct. I think so. Because our disconnection request was automatically cancelled by the distributor. Okay, that's perfectly fine. No worries. That's all right. No worries. Thank you so much. Okay, no problem. Thanks. Thank you so much. Bye.
