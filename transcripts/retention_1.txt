This call is being recorded. If you do not wish to be recorded, please disconnect at this time. Sanerji, you're speaking to Varun Haukannahal. G'day, you're speaking to Peter. I'm with Bill Hero, who you know about Bill Hero. And they told us the changing from First Saver to First Saver will save me 241 bucks a year. Okay, yeah, let me have a look now, just to let you know, calls are recorded for quality and compliance purposes. Do you have your customer number, account number, please? I swear words. Do you have your customer number, please? Look, I just had it and I threw it... It's gone. Where is it? Here, I got it. Customer number, 327585. Okay, let me pull up the details, Peter. Now, just for the security of the account, can you confirm your full name, full address and date of birth, please? Peter Kinross, 3 Mayoon Accord, Paterson Lakes, 5th of July, 46. How come you didn't send me a birthday card? Still time. I use that line on a lot of people and most people don't get it. They start apologizing profusely. Well done. Go to the top of the class. Okay, let me check here. Okay, so currently you are on the First Super Saver plan, right? And if I change to that plan, I'd save 241 bucks a year. No problem. Okay, so currently you're getting $10, sorry, 10% discount on your usage charges plus $100 in rebates as a credit from First Energy. That's the plan you are on at the moment? Yep. Alright, so yeah, there is a plan which is called First Saver. Yep. Okay, so now instead of 10%, this plan gives you 23% guaranteed discount on the usage charges. Good. But if I change your plan, you will lose the $100 credits which you were supposed to get on the current plan. Okay, but I'll still get to save $241. Yeah, I'm just checking your bill. That's only $141. Yeah, if I move away from First Saver, I lose that $100 too, don't I? On the new plan, First Saver, the thing only you're getting is only 23% discount, no credits or rebates. But on your current plan, you are getting a 10% discount plus $100. Yeah, and if I change over to this one, how much of that $100 do I lose? Well, let me check your bill. Okay. So if you have the same, I'm just, let me calculate your last bill with the new rates with 23% and see how much you're saving per bill, and then you have an idea. Okay. So compared to your last bill, Peter, as you can see, your bill was $184.15, and then you get a 10% discount. Your bill comes down to $168.94. Now with 23% discount, your same bill will be $149.14. So if you see you're saving $18.85, so you can say $20 to be precise, every month with the same amount of usage with the new plan. So if you calculate that, yeah, so two point, yeah, perfect. All right. Now, even if you are changing your plan in Victoria for the compliance purposes, I still need to read out the terms and conditions again. Yeah, I know it's a little frustrating, but that's for the compliance purposes. I need to read it out again. I'm in life insurance and it drives me round the twist. Yeah, kick out. All right. Now I'm just going to ask you the same questions again, which was asked earlier, when you actually signed up with us. Now, are you the primary account holder authorized to enter this contract? For example, your name is currently on the contract, but you're not authorized to enter the contract. For example, your name is currently on the energy bills. Yes. Okay. Any solar panels at the property? No. Do you have any medical equipment at the property for life support? No. Okay. Any concession cards? A senior's card, but that doesn't count. Okay. Yeah, correct. All right. Now today's date is 16th of May, 23. My name is Varun, as I mentioned earlier. I'm a senior, and I'm a senior in compliance purposes. Now, based on the information you have provided and our assessment, we can offer you the first saver product, and I will provide you some information now so that you can make a comparison against the Victorian default offer and understand how much your discount is. Now, all amounts quoted are inclusive of GST. We can offer you the first energy, which is $218 less than the current Victorian default offer that is also available from First Energy. Now, based on an annual medium user reference consumption of 4,000 kilowatt hours per year, the estimated value of your electricity supply before any period of time discount would be $1,105. The guaranteed discount is estimated at $213. Now, the key terms and conditions of our first saver product is a market retail contract with ongoing benefits, no fixed term and no exit fee for the supply of electricity with First Energy, which comes with a 23% guaranteed discount on the usage charges only. Now, would you like to hear your new rates as well over the phone, or you're happy to get them and you're welcome back? Yeah, go for it. No, I'm happy. Just change me over. Now, currently, let me check. So, you get your bills and communications sent out every month. You happy with that? Say that again? You're getting your bills every month, so you're happy with monthly bills? I prefer never, but I'm not going to get that, am I? Everybody prefers that. Yeah, no, I'm ecstatically happy with monthly. Yeah. Throw a party every time I get the bill. Yeah. And would you like to receive your bills and communications via email? Happy with email bill as well? Yep, that's cool. Perfect. Now, this is a question for you. If you're happy for the change of plan, just a yes or no will do after this question. Now, would you like to proceed with entering into a contract with First Energy as your new energy retailer and understand this is not a request for information only, just a yes or no? Yes. That's great. Now, in order to transfer you to the new plan, I'm just going to confirm the details we already have here on the system. Peter, just bear with me here.
