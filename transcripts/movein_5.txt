This call is being recorded. If you do not wish to be recorded, please disconnect at this time. So, Sena G is speaking to Varun Hakanal. This is Jess from call centre. I just have Hayden on the line. He's called to set up a new account for an account we already have, which is 236921. Okay. So, he's advised that he'd be happy to take over the account retrospectively. He's just recently purchased business, but he's unable to complete the ID check. He does have every intention of paying what he owes on this one though for his usage. Oh, okay. That's alright. No problem. Oh, $3600. Okay. And what's his name, you said? His name is Hayden. Hayden, okay. No problem. You can put them through. Awesome. Have a good one. See you. Bye. Hi, good afternoon. Welcome to First Energy. My name is Varun. I'm speaking to Hayden. Yeah, that's right, mate. Hayden. Hi, Hayden. How are you doing? Not too bad, mate. How are you? I'm good as well. Thank you for asking. Well, just to let you know, calls are recorded for quality and compliance purposes before we proceed. And my colleague just mentioned that you want to take over this account, right? So, you're the new owner of this property? Yes, mate. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Okay. Can you confirm the address you're taking over, please? Yeah, it's 9 Shipley Drive, Rutherford, New South Wales. Okay, perfect. So, when exactly did you take over this property from? What date? Mate, I'll just bring it up on my thing here. I'm not 100% sure, to be honest. Let me just bring the calendar up, actually. I might be able to… Because I want to sort this, that account out. That is Owen on there. But let me just have a quick look. Yeah, because I can see an outstanding balance of more than $3,000. Yeah. So, I just got a phone call off the landlord, Robert McDonald, and he just told me that he had a phone call saying that it was going to be a final notice. They wanted you to disconnect the energy. And I said, I haven't even seen the bill yet. And he goes, oh, there's one. I got one, but he just hadn't passed it on to us yet. But I've got it now in front of me for $3,295.54. And I'll just have a look at the dates here and there now. Let's see if I can get it to load for me. Sorry. So, we took over this premises on the 13th of March. Oh, OK. OK. Yep. So, you're happy to pay that amount, you're saying? Yeah, I'm happy to pay that amount. I just wanted to see if it was at all possible if I could get maybe a week just to get myself sorted and back on track again. And see if I could have like, yeah, just the due by date for a week's time, if that's at all possible. I know it might be progressing the relationship for a couple of reasons. OK, because I'm from sales team. Now, any account which has more than $1,000 pending amount. Yep. That needs to go through with our credit team. So, I will have to ask them first if they can put in any exception on this bill. So, because you are at the property since, I think, two or three months now. And this amount, if you're ready to pay, that's completely fine. I can let them know. But then you are only requesting that you need a week's notice or something like that? Yeah, just a week's notice. Just for the whole amount or you can pay something now? I can pay a proportion of it now, yeah. OK. Give me one moment, yeah. Let me have a quick word with them. Just bear with me. So, the amount owing is, that is, if you paid by due date, which was 10th of May, which is $3,295. Is that what you have? Yeah, so that's the paper I've got here now. By the look of the bill, it's $3,659. $3,659, correct. Yes, correct. 74 cents. And 74 cents, yeah. Yes, correct. OK. I mean, today, I could pay $1,000 today. OK. And if I could pay the rest by the end of, by this time next week, if that's possible at all. OK. Give me one moment. Let me have a quick word with them. Just bear with me. No worries. Thank you. Thanks. Hi, Denny. Yeah. All right. So, yeah, let's get started. So, that's all good. So, we can go ahead with that. So, let's create your first account, a new account first, under your details, under your name. And then I'm going to take a $1,000 payment from you on your new account. And then also leave a note on the new account that you have taken over this account and will be paying the remaining amount in the next few days, which is within a week or 10 days. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just bear with me. Thank you. It's OK. No worries. You're good. Thank you. All right. So, the address you're taking over is 9 Shipley Drive, Rutherford, New South Wales, 2320. Yep, that's right.

And we're putting it under your name from the 15th of March, 2023? OK. OK. All right. Now, based on the information you have provided and assessment, we can offer you the first save of product. Now, all amounts quoted are inclusive of GST. We can offer you the first save of product, which is 10% less than the reference price. The estimated minimum annual spend per annum is $3,893. This estimated cost is rounded to the nearest dollar and is based on an average residential annual usage of 10,000 kilowatt hours per year and the single rate tariff in the Ausgrid network area. Your bill will differ based on your actual usage only. Now, would you like to hear your electricity rates over the phone as well or are you happy to get them in your welcome pack? No, I'm happy with the key goal. All right. Now, the key terms and conditions of our first save of product is a market rate and contract with ongoing benefits, no fixed term and no exit fees for the supply of electricity with First Energy, which comes with a 10% guaranteed discount on the usage and supply charges both. Now, how would you like to receive your bills and communications, email or by post? Email would be fine. Perfect. And you're happy with monthly bills or you want quarterly bills? Monthly would be perfect, yeah. Okay. Now, because you're billing your monthly when no actual rate is available, we'll estimate your electricity bill. Your initial estimated bills will be based on an average use by a comparable customer and then by using average energy usage based on your previous actual rates. If we calculate your estimated bill too high or too low, this will be automatically adjusted on your next bill after we receive an actual reading for your meter. Now, do you have any questions at the moment before I confirm your details? No, that's fine. Okay. Now, this is a question for you. I just need a yes or no as an answer if you're happy for the takeover of the account. Now, would you like to proceed with entering into a contract with First Energy as your new energy retailer and understand this is not a request for information only, just a yes or no? Yes.
