First, Angie Wang speaking, how can I help you? Hi Wayne, it's the Hesley & McCaw Centre. I have customer 169835. Yep, so Victoria, how can I help? So at the moment Victoria has an outstanding amount. She says she'll pay $100 this week but needs to set up a payment plan. She's not sure if she can make a payment of $100 weekly or fortnightly. She said that the least she can do is about $50 just because she's part-time. Put her on either chat with her, we'll see what we can do. Awesome, thank you. Transferring in 3, 2, 1. Hello, this is Wayne speaking from First Energy. Hello, how are you going? I've got an overdue bill I was hoping to pay. I'm $100 off my debit card now and making a direct debit payment plan. Yep, so in regards to payment plan, the way the payment plan usually works, the system generates an amount based off your usage and consumption. I can see we've previously set you up an arrangement quite some time ago. I'm happy to set you up another arrangement now. But let's have a quick look and see what the system generates and we can discuss it from there. So in this particular case here, did you want to do it weekly or fortnightly? Weekly. Weekly, okay. So on a weekly basis over 12 weeks, the amount that you technically should be paying is about $145 a week. Oh really, that much? Yep. The reason is because your debt is quite high on the account. Yep, okay. All right, no worries. Yep, okay. Well, I have to pay $145. I'll pay $145. I'll just have to squeeze it until I can. Yep. So if you want to do $145 a week, when can you make your first payment? Next Friday. So next week Friday, sure. We'll start that as of the 26th of May, 2023. And we'll put it in $145. And you said you want it via direct debit, was that correct? Yes, please. No worries. Give me one moment. I'll set that up for you. Thank you. Okay, and so that's been set up for you here. And we'll do the direct debit and the payment. So you're saying you're making the payment over the phone today? $100, please. Yep, no worries. I can do that for you. Okay, so I'm going to give the details twice, one for the payment and then one for the direct debit. So I'm going to place the call recording on hold now. Okay, the call recording has been resumed. The payment has been successful. Do you like the receipt number? No, it's okay. Thank you. No worries. Then I'll look into – I'm just going to leave a note on the system. And then we'll look into setting up the direct debit for the payment arrangement. Yep. No worries. But we can't make it just for $100 a week because, you know, $145 would really be stretching it for me. So realistically, the calculation only done it for the overdue balance. You actually have $1,216.15. So the amount actually is lower than what it should have been. Okay, make it $145. Can I just keep paying it weekly until like the whole off phase or what? The arrangement will go for 12 weeks and then we can reassess at that stage. So hopefully the amount goes down and we can probably reduce the amount as well. Okay, thank you. So I'm just setting this up and then we'll go through the direct debit details again to set up for direct debit. Okay, bear with me one moment. Okay, yep. And this is with the credit card or the bank account details? Because we actually have bank account details on the account. Yep, the bank account details. Perfect. So if that's the case, I will just use that same one again for an activated for the arrangement. Everything you advised in regards to that remains to be the same. Just go in for the direct debit and it will last as long as the payment arrangement. And the directive will end at the end of the arrangement and then we can reassess at that stage as advised before. That's basically all been done for you. Do you want me to go through your payment assistance entitlements today? Yes, thank you. Yep, give me one moment. So in regards to this, we just want to advise you. So I'd just like to confirm so you're aware when you've arrays your various payment assistance entitlements including a flexible payment arrangement, assistance in accessing government and non-government support services, up-to-date information, help monitor usage, a list of NGC's to lower future NGC costs, review NGC rates and guidance on how to access financial counsellor. Do you understand all your entitlements and you contact First NGC if your circumstances change? No, I don't know if that's the case. So do you want me to go through that again or did you understand what I just told you? Yes, yeah, I did, it's alright. Okay then, if that's the case, that's all been done for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today? No, thank you very much for your help. No worries, thank you very much and have a good day. Okay, thanks, bye. Bye.
