Hello, I'm calling because I've got First Energy connected at my house, but my housemate had the account in her name and she's now moved out. I'm just wondering how to transfer that to my mate. Yeah, we could set it up in your name. What is the address for the property first of all? It's unit 2 of 5 Tower Road. And the suburb? Newtown. Okay, let's have a look. Just going to find the current account, and then what we can do is we can just do a change of ownership at the last metre reading, so the next bill that generates ends up being in your name. Okay. And I'll just double check when that last metre reading was. So 22nd of February, 23 was the last metre reading, so it's actually one due very shortly, but yes, you're happy to take over as of the last reading, so the next bill will generate in your name. There's no locking contracts, no transfer fees. I can see the property has no solar panels. And are you a member with the RACT by any chance? I am, yeah. Perfect. So we can place you on the same offer where you'll receive a 6% guaranteed discount off the usage. And in order to set this up, I just have to read through some scripts and then I'll grab your details along the way. Perfect, so I'll go through. That's okay. So you're speaking with Annika from First Energy on the 15th of May, 23. This call has been recorded for quality and compliance purposes. And before we proceed, can you confirm, do you have any type of medical equipment at your property for life support? No. And the address that we're setting up in your name is unit 2, number 5, Tower Road, Newtown, 7008. Is this correct? Mm-hmm. I'm sorry, just a yes or no? Perfect. And now, based on the information you've provided and our assessment, we can offer you the RACT Saver product. All amounts quoted are inclusive of GST. The key terms and conditions of our RACT Saver product is a market retail contract with minimum 12-month benefit period, no fixed term and no exit fees for the supply of electricity with First Energy, which comes with a 6% guaranteed discount off the usage. Now, would you like to hear all the rates? Are you happy for them to be sent in the welcome pack? I don't need to hear them, no. That's okay. Would you like to receive your bills and other communications from First Energy via email or post? Email, please. Email. And do you prefer monthly or quarterly billing? Um... Oh... Maybe... I don't know. It's up to you at the moment. It's on three months. Yeah, can we change it? Yeah, it's up to you. If we start making it monthly, could we then change it? Yeah, you can change it at any point in time. There's no issues there. Okay. Cool. Well, maybe we'll go with monthly, then we can get a bit of a better idea of budgeting. Yeah, not a problem. So First Energy will send you a monthly electricity bill via email and send you any notices and communications electronically. And because we are billing you monthly, when no actual rate is available, we'll estimate your electricity bill. Your initial estimated bills will be based on the average usage by a comparable customer, and then by using the average energy usage based on your previous actual rates. If we calculate your estimated bill to be too high or too low, this will automatically be adjusted on your next bill after we receive an actual rate for your meter. And just going off the previous usage, we can start the estimate at $120 monthly, and that will be adjusted once the meter is read. Okay, and when does it get read? So if it's a standard meter, it's quarterly. If it's a smart meter, it'll be actual rates each month. So it just depends on the type of meter you have. So it'll be like a set rate per month until it's read quarterly? On the third month, yep, correct. Which is soon anyway, right? What was that, sorry? Which is due soon anyway, I believe. Yes, correct. It should be at the end of this week, actually, so yep. Cool. Great. And now, would you like to proceed with entering into a contract with First Energy as your new energy retailer? And understand this is not a request for information only. Yes or no? Yes. And I'll just grab your details now. So what is your first name? Kelsey, K-E-L-S-E-A. So K-E-L-S-E-A. Yep. And surname? Morris, M-O-R-R-I-S. M-O-R-R-I-S. Yep. And date of birth? 1st of the 9th, 1990. 1st of the 9th, 1990. And is the best contact number 0490 424 803? Yes. And your email? Kelsey.Morris at Hotmail.com. That's K-E-L-S-E-A. Yep, so K-E-L-S-E-A dot M-O-R-R-I-S at Hotmail.com. That's it, yep. And the postal address, will that be 2 slash 5 Cower Road, Newtown 7008? Yep.

And expiry? 15th of November, 2017. 15th of November, 2017. And is that a Tassie licence? Yep, it is. And do you hold any concession cards? No. No, that's okay. Is there a discount if I do? Because my partner does. Yep, so does your partner have a health care or pension card? He does, yeah. So you do receive a further discount, so the concession discounts from the government if either of you do hold a concession card. I can add your partner's name as a secondary contact, but your partner will have to call in order to add their concession. Perfect. What was first name? Bryce, B-R-Y-C-E. B-R-Y-C-E. And surname?

So I'll add him on the account and I'll leave a clear note that you've given permission for Bryce to be on the account and add his concession. Bryce will just have to give us a call to give his consent and to provide his concession card. We'll just have to play a little script. So that's fine. And I will also just need your RSC team membership number. Yep. I'll just find that on. Number, number. 0811 1996. So 0811 966. Perfect. And now the final thing.
