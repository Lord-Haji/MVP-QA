Hello, I was just calling to... Well, I'm with Red Energy at the moment for our electricity. Yeah. And I just wanted to get a comparison, if I can. Yeah, no problem. Electricity, yeah. Yeah, what is your address, just so I can bring up our rates and offer and we can go from there. Sure. So, address is 40... Yep. ...Vasari, V for Victor, A-S-A-R-I. Yep. Dardens in Mernda, M-E-R-N-D-A. Okay, there we go. And does your property have any solar panels? No, it doesn't, no. And how many people are living at the property? Four. Four. And, so do you have your bill there with Red Energy at the moment, so the rates that they charge you? Yes, I do, a recent one, yep. Perfect. So, I'll quote you our rates, including GST, and we see our discount, which is a 15% guaranteed discount off the usage. So, first, our daily supply charge is $1.29 per day. On that bill, it should say what their supply charge is on the second page. So, it's got... Supply charge, remote meter index. Where would I find that? Is that the meter, sorry, the usage, did you say? Or rate per kilowatt, is that it? We can actually just do a bill for bill comparison, that's probably going to be easier. So, what is your usage on that bill? Okay, so it's got 2836. Yep. So, 2836 as the usage per kilowatt hour. Total, yep. Yeah, so it's got like two steps, it's got step one, and then it's got like an amount, and then it's got step two, and then another amount, and then it adds up to 2836, and it's got two different rates. Perfect, yep, that's fine. And how many days is that bill for? 88 days. 88 days, alright. And do you hold any concession cards? No. Okay, so. Okay, so that bill with us would have been $833.29. How much would you have to pay with your current retailer? So, sorry, with you it would have been how much? $833.29, so let's say $833 if we round it off. Oh, okay, yes. So, $933. So about $100 cheaper, so that's a fair bit of savings. See that, so over a year, say that was our bill average for every quarter. Yep, so four quarters in a year, so $400 approximately, so a huge difference. Yeah, see when I did the comparison, because you know how the government's giving every household the $250 for the electricity? When I did that comparison, First Energy came up as like the better one of all of them, but it said like when I was doing it, it said $1000 savings a year. But I don't know how they work that out, maybe I put it in wrong. I'm not sure. It depends what details you would have put down, like it asks a few questions, I think, like how many people are living there, do you have gas heating or electrical, and I think there's a few questions. Do you use gas as well? Yeah, we also do gas, so I can go through the gas offer, do a comparison just like we have for the electricity. I don't have the gas bill. I should just move both of them over, shouldn't I? So if I wanted to change over from Red Energy to First Energy, is that something that I have to do? Or do I have to cancel it with Red Energy first? We do it all for you, so what happens is if you say yes I'm happy to proceed, I read through a few scripts, grab your details, then you get a 10 business day cooling off period. Once that's up, we notify your current retailer that we're taking over, and it just automatically transfers with no interruption. So you get a final bill from them, and the bill after that is from us. So it's nice and easy. I'm just going to quickly try and find that gas bill. I should have one here. Yep. Here we go, beautiful, got it. Just make sure it's your latest gas bill because there was a gas rate increase as of February 1st. I'm going to try and find it after. It was last year. It's not going to be an accurate comparison just because their rates would have gone up. It doesn't matter, I'll still just change it over because I'd rather have both of them with the same company. That's perfectly fine. So yeah, if you're happy to proceed, I'll just have to go through some scripts and then grab your details. Yep, alright, let's do that. Perfect. So I'll go through. Sorry, can I just ask you, do you have like payment plans? As in where you pay like every two weeks or in advance? Yeah, or every month or something. Yeah, so with our electricity bills they are actually sent monthly. Gas is every two months. But if you do want to pay in advance there's no problems with that. Then once the bill generates you're either going to a credit or you just pay the remainder of what's all in. Okay. So yeah. Perfect, so happy to proceed? Yes. Perfect, so I'll just go through.
