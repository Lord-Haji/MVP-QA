Thank you for calling First Energy. You're speaking with Rabia. How can I help? Rabia, it's Jess from call center. I just have a weird one for you. I've got Andrew Glover on the line. His customer number is 209717. He's fully ID'd with OTP. He'd like to set up a payment plan. It looks like he's been disconnected due to non-payment and it's showing that it was completed on the 8th of May here. But he's advised that there is still power supplied to the site. So the site is not disconnected, yeah? Yeah, but it's saying that the service order was completed. So I'm just not sure what to do with this one. Yeah, sometimes they just reconnect it themselves. So you're not just illegally reconnection. So that might be the case. Let me check. Okay, yeah, that's fine. I can take the call. No worries. He's fully ID'd, right? Yes, with OTP. Thank you. No worries. See ya. Good morning. MSP with Andrew. Yes, you are. Hi, Andrew. This is Rabia from credit department. How are you this morning? Good, thank you. That's good. I would just like to advise the call to be recorded for quality and coaching purposes. So you would like to go on a payment plan, is that correct? Sorry? You would like to go on a payment plan or how can I help? Yeah, payment plan, please. Okay. So, Andrew, just confirming that previously you had two payment arrangements which were incomplete due to some missing payments. I can see that we have received $400 of e-payment vouchers as well. Was there any reason that you couldn't make those payments previously? I mean, are you struggling financially or was there any reason that you couldn't pay? I was paying off work because I've got COVID. Okay. All right, so you're not working at the moment. I hope you're feeling better. Yeah, I am. All right. Okay. So, Andrew, before going on a payment plan, are you in a position, you know, to make some payment, you know, like upfront payment towards the account? Not today, but next fortnight, yes. Next fortnight, okay. All right, so previously you were paying $150 a fortnight. Are you able to pay that much every fortnight or what's your current situation? $150 is fine. $150, okay. What day would you like to start your payment plan from? On next fortnight Thursday. Okay. Sorry, what was the line? And have you got any concession card, Andrew? No, I don't. Okay. For the payments, would you prefer setting up a direct debit or you can pay by BPAY or at the post office? Yeah, BPAY. I think I've already got a direct debit set up for my bank account. Okay. So, the fortnight Thursday would be 1st of June. Is that correct? Would that be okay? Yeah. Okay. So, your payment plan starts from 1st of June, $150 for six fortnights and it will be completed by 10th of August. Andrew, you will be receiving a confirmation letter. You can always give us a call back in case of any changes and once it gets completed, if you have got any overdue balance, we will just give you a call to review your account. Just be mindful, Andrew, because previously you had two incomplete payment arrangements. So, if you don't complete this one or if it's being cancelled, so we won't be able to go ahead with another one unless you cover for the previous payment plan. All good. If you can't make any installment or if you are having any difficulty, you can always give us a call back, let us know. Otherwise, you might be receiving a few reminders regarding your payment plan. That's all being done. Before letting you go, would you like me to go through your payment assistance entitlements today? Is there any better plan or no? Andrew, for that case, I can transfer your call to our sales department. They might be able to assist you with that. Okay. Yeah. Do you want me to transfer now? Yes, please. Sure. No worries. Won't be long. I'm so sorry, Andrew, to keep you waiting for a few minutes. I do apologize for that. Unfortunately, no one is picking up my call. They might be busy with another call. If you want, I can arrange a call back for you from someone from sales. Sure. All set. Would you prefer a call back? I'm so sorry, but no one is picking up my call at the moment. They might be busy with other calls. If you would like, I can arrange a call back from someone from sales department. Hello? Hello? Hello? Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, no worries. All good. Thank you for your time. You take care. Thank you. Bye-bye.
