Hi Annika, it's Sue here from the call centre. I have customer 254594. Sorry, 354594 was it? Yeah, 254594. Oh sorry, 25... Linda? Yeah, for Linda. At the moment, what she's wanting, she's wanting to discuss a better discount just because she reckons the one she's on isn't that good. It doesn't suit her. Okay, let me just see. Was she fully ID'd with OTP? Yep, you can transfer her over. Awesome, thank you. Transferring in 3, 2, 1. Hi Linda, you're speaking with Annika from First Energy. How are you going today? Not too good. They put me through to you so that we can discuss a guaranteed discount at a better price. Yep, so yeah, the previous... I'm having a lot of trouble with these bills. Yep, now let me have a look to see the current offer that you are on and I will see how it compares to any new deals that we have. There we go. So... Yep, so you are on our old offer and let me just cross check. Okay. Perfect. So our new offer will work out cheaper for you. Now the discount, it's 5% pay on time discount off the usage and supply. So it is actually less than your discount. You've got 10% guaranteed plus 3% pay on time. However, the new offer, the rates are cheaper. So it will work out cheaper for you by updating you to the new offer? Yeah, because seriously I can't see how my bill is as dear as it is when I'm the only one home. I only use one appliance at a time. I'm using a gas cooker and I light candles at night. Yep, okay. So in terms of the bill and so on, the previous representative should have explained the bill to you. Like through my end I can just go through the rates and the offer to see whether you're right. This is an estimated bill so how can you charge $107 just as an estimate? Okay, if you're wanting clarity over that I can get our customer service team. Did the previous representative explain the bill to you? Did you already go through this with her? I thought it was $193 to pay but she said no it's only $107 because I paid part of the bill after. That's okay. So my question is, did the previous representative already explain the bill or did you need more clarity over? I need more clarity. Is it because I paid late that this bill is so high? Okay, so I'll have to transfer you back to customer service to go through the estimated billing and so on. If you want, before I transfer you, if you want me to upgrade your offer to our new offer which will be cheaper for you, I can do that and then transfer you over? Yes please. Alright, so let's upgrade the offer at least that way you'll be on the new deal. In order to upgrade the offer I have to read through a bit of a script and then just confirm your details we have are up to date. So there we go. I'll go through. You're speaking with Annika from First Energy on the 16th of May 2023. This call has been recorded for quality and compliance purposes and before we proceed can you confirm do you have any type of medical equipment at your property for life support? No. And are you the authorized person to enter a contract for this property? So for example your name may be on the current bills, yes or no? Yes. And the address again was 31 Pacific Avenue Anna Bay 2316, is this correct? Yes. And we'll place you on our first saver product based on the information you've provided and our assessment. All amounts quoted are inclusive of GST. We can offer you the first saver product which is equal to the reference price with an additional 5% discount off the reference price if you always pay on time. And the estimated minimum annual spend per annum is $1,998. This estimated cost is rounded to the nearest dollar and is based on an average residential annual usage of 6,800 kilowatt hours with a single rate and controlled load two tariff in the Ausgrid network area. Your bill will differ based on your actual usage. The key terms and conditions of our first saver product is a market retail contract with an ongoing benefit period, no sixth term and no exit fees for the supply of electricity with First Energy which comes with a 5% pay on time discount off usage and supply. To receive your pay on time discount you must pay the bill in full by 5pm on the due date. And would you like me to read out the individual rates or do you want me to just send them out to you so you have it in writing? Send it out please. And do I still get a pensioner discount? Yeah you still get that as per normal, that's fine. So First Energy will send you... When this government rebate comes in does that automatically get paid? Like concession discounts, is that what you mean? Well the $500 that the government's going to give... I'm not sure how that rebate works but any government initiatives it'll be the same process regardless of who you're with, whether you have to apply for it separately or whether it's automatic. I don't actually have the answer to that. Our customer service team might be able to confirm that or you'd have to look into the incentive to see how it works. Yeah, so and let me... I've just got a little bit more to go through so we can upgrade the offer. And First Energy will send you a monthly electricity bill via the post and send you any notices and communications via the post. Do you provide your consent to receive postal communications? Can you say that again? So First Energy will send you a monthly electricity bill via the post and send you any notices and communications via the post. So do you provide your consent to receive postal communications? Yeah but I thought we were changing this to three monthly. Oh okay, sorry I can do three monthly if it was recently changed. I was just looking at the previous bill. I'm just wondering because I'm in between readings whether I'd have to wait until the next charge which is a... not an estimated reading. So the next bill will be an actual read by changing its quarterly billing. Sorry I can see the previous representative did actually just change its quarterly billing. So that's okay. So I just have to read that statement again and just get your consent. So First Energy will send you a quarterly electricity bill via the post and send you any notices and communications via the post. Do you provide your consent to receive postal communications? Yes. And would you like to proceed with amending your existing retail market contract with First Energy and understand this is not a request for information only? Yes or no? Yes. And I'll just confirm your details are correct. So your name is spelled L-I-N-D-A and then P-A-R-S-O-N-S and middle name starts with T. Date of birth 13th of November 62. Email L-I-N-D-A. dot P dot S-H-A-D at hotmail dot com. And mobile 0415 868 722. And postal address unit 1 number 31 Pacific Avenue Anna Bay 2316. Is that all up to date? And are you happy for your pension card to remain on the account which was 201 38177A? Yes. Perfect. So the offer has all been updated. Now if you want clarity over the bill I'm happy to transfer you back to customer service and they can explain the estimates and so on. No, I'm timed out. Timed out? That's okay. Well at least you've upgraded your offer and yep so it'll be cheaper on the new offer moving forward. Okay, thank you. All right well have a lovely day and if you have any further questions don't hesitate to call us. Okay, thank you. Bye. Thank you. Bye.
