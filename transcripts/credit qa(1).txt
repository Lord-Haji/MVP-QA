Hi, this is Rose. How can I help? Hello? Yeah, hello. I'm sorry, it's just a bit hard to hear. Yeah, I've got two accounts with First Energy. Can I give you my number and you can pull them up? Yeah, when you're ready. Mine is 0422 656 425. What's your name and date of birth? Caroline Dutta, 25th of the 2nd 1969. How can I help? Yeah, I've overdue on both accounts. Now, I was supposed to do that energy relief, but I never, I asked to get a paper form. I never got it. So, it made my account fall behind. So, I just want to pay a little bit towards each one and then just make an arrangement for the rest. Or if I could get that paper sent out again, that would be great. Okay, so I'm just seeing, this is the electricity. It's $1,158. So, the grant will only get you $650 if you are approved. I've paid two payments towards that. It shouldn't be that high. It should be around $800 I think. You have a new bill that's come out on the 1st of this month. $200. Yeah. So, are you able to make that regular payment of $200? Yeah, last time I spoke, I said they were going to do a direct debit. They didn't say to go behind. Oh, okay. How much was it approved? Let me check. Yeah, $200. It looks like the direct debit wasn't set up correctly or wasn't activated. So, I can set that up. Could it be a bit less than $200? $200 I might be struggling to try to keep up with it. Okay, so. I'll read the grant. When I get that, I'll just give it credit. Just in case that doesn't go through, I'll still want to organise something for that bill anyway. I mean, I can do the grant with you over the phone if you want. It could be better so you don't have to get the form filled out. Okay then, that's fine. If I could do that, that would be great. Okay, thanks Paul. Bye. Bye.
