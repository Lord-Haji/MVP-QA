So we can update your offer if you're not on our latest offer. I do have an account loading up here with your phone number. So can I get you to say your full name and date of birth? Yeah, Virginia Maria Pauley, 30th of the 11th, 1971. And just your address? 36 Earl Street, Airport West, 3064. 42, sorry, 42. Yes, perfect.
