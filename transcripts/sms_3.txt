Ok Mukta, so there's a cut off time for this afternoon, press next. Now there will be two boxes that say you're changing retail as you're moving, can you tell me when you get to that page please? We went to the next one, first saver electricity and it says 1% less, what's that? 5% pay on time discount off. Yes, so every retailer they have to give the price that the government says and our price is 1% less than the reference, that's called a reference price. So the discounts that you're getting on the account is 5% but that 1% that just tells you where our offer sits against the government offer. I'll tell you less than the government offer. Yeah, yeah. We'll go to details, how about this click 040 550 783. Ok. And then click next. 65 Ferguson Avenue, Wally Park, yep that's right, I'm changing retailers. Yeah, can you, yeah don't put your moving, leave changing retailers, what that means if you put moving or put tomorrow's date, if you put your changing retailers I'll grab the order in the next 5 minutes from this end and I'll push it out for this afternoon for you urgently, that's why. So leave it that you're changing retailers. So just leave it at that? Yeah, and I'll change it myself, I'll get someone out this afternoon. Now I asked Mokta before, there is clear access to the meter, there's no fence or door, the meter's not locked anywhere beyond the gate? No, it's locked, it's a clock so it should work. That's fine, good. Is anyone at your property on life support, if we say yes, because he's an elderly person and he used a bit of emergency like things, so does that work? No, no, it's how it works, if you put yes we have to flag it, then we have to put the reason, so we have to tell us, has the customer got a medical alarm, have they got a sleep apnea machine, so I ask them those questions, so if he hasn't got any kind of medical equipment then we can't flag it. And what if he has equipment then? Then normally get a letter from the doctor and then they send the forms out. Oh, you mean that sort of thing? Yeah, yeah, but the doctor... He's quite an aged person, so he knows, yeah. Yeah, but he hasn't got any medical equipment plugged into all that he uses for sleeping or breathing or anything? Which I have got? No. You don't have any clips about that? No. No? Watch out. Okay. All right, now that you've said, so now we go to this one, life, support and condition, that's right, so we need to click the box now? No, it should be there, just wait a few minutes, I've already put his card number in. He's mentioned card number, he did that. Yeah, then click next, and then there's some boxes, you have to read them and tick them and click create my account, so you're nearly there. All right, hold on, so I've mentioned a card number, 209244671X, start date 8th of June, 30th June, 2024, 3223, it's almost over, you have 23 days left, 24th, 23rd June, 24th of June, 24th of June, what's the other one?

No, I'm from India. You're Indian? Yes. Oh, so you understand Hindi? I can understand it, but I can't speak it. Yeah, we're Pakistani, so, yeah. And also, to discuss the account in case in future, because I'm also staying with him, like in other rooms, so... Yeah, what I'll do is give me two minutes, I can change it on the system, just stay there, I need to ask both of you questions. What I'm going to do, just put Mukta on the... I'll get your name as well, so I have to ask him, because I've got to ask him permission to get you on the account, and I'll ask you to... So, I'll get your details first, just stay there. Yeah, and then we don't have to worry. What information do you need? My name and my number, isn't it? Yeah, what I need from you, hang on, just stay there, just your name, your full name. Yeah. What's your first name? Before I say anything, what information would you need from me? My name and number? Just name, address and date of birth, that's it, and phone number. Okay, so name is Yasser, Y-A-S-S-E-R. Yep. Date of birth is September 25th, 1980. I mean, I'm not the account holder, and I'm not... Nana? ...going to account, it should not affect my credit history. Nana, we're going to put you on the account, so you can... ...ring up and make changes or make queries, is that what you want? Yeah, that's right, let me then query your... Yeah, hang on. So, 26th of September? 25th of 1980. 25 or 26? Yeah, so 25th or 26th, because the head's just not that clear. It's 25. 25, yep, 2509-... 19X. 1980, okay. And your mobile number, please. It's 0491-655-943. So, you don't want to be on the bill, you just want to be on the account, is that right? Yeah, that's right, I don't want to be on the bill, of course. Yeah, cool. Okay, then, I'll get that for you. I'm just sort of, yeah... Yeah, sorry, what's your surname again? Aftab, A-F-T-A-B. Aftab, yeah, cool. So, I'll just put you on the account, so, you're just authorised on the account, that's it. You won't be on the bill. Yep. Cool. Now, on the last page, just read and tick the full box and then click Create My Account. It says, by clicking, sorry, by selecting the checkbox, I understand, I'll try the above and constant first energy. Accessing my information held by Centrelink and the partners, right? Yeah. So, what they do, they check this card again, send them to make sure it's all correct. Sometimes there'll be a mistake, so they just check the spelling. That's why I asked them for the family name, because if he didn't give me his surname, the card would have failed. That's why they check it all to make sure. So, just tick and read those four boxes and then click Create My Account and it's all done. And I'll get someone out this afternoon to get it done for you. All right. Four boxes, isn't it? Yeah. Just read them and tick. Each box, you have to read them. There's no lock and contract. No, you just have to go into each box, arrow down, otherwise we'll just keep on going around in circles for 10 minutes. So, you're nearly there. I'm trying to grab the order for you guys to get it done for this evening. Yeah, just scroll down and... Yeah. And do I need to cross it or just accept it? Yeah, just accept them. Yeah, on each one. I think there's three or four, but if you don't, we won't create the account. So, by me giving the details, my date of birth and my number, it doesn't affect my carer's history or anything? No, no, say you call in tomorrow and say, I want an update, we'll say, what's your name, what's your date of birth? We only put that into the system to ID you when you call in. So, you're not on the account, we're not doing a credit check on you. Oh, yeah, that's right. Yeah. And if I want to have it removed in the future, I can, yeah? Yeah. Okay. All right. So, we got it now, brother. Powering your day. You're all set up. Welcome to First Energy. Soon you will receive a welcome email. Yep, done. Yep, so I'll grab it. I'll grab our next half now and get it pushed out to Ausgrid to come out this afternoon for you. So, thanks for that. And don't worry, that fee, that connection fee, you don't have to pay anything. It comes on your first bill. So, don't worry, you don't have to pay anything. On the first. Yeah. The bill is costly? Yeah, bill's costly. But any discounts you get for being a pensioner? Yes, you get the pensioner discount. I've already put the card on, so you'll see on the first bill. How much is it? It varies from, yeah, I don't know what discount is. It changes from state to state. So, all we do, we just put the card number in and the system works out and puts it on the bill automatically. I just checked it online that the electricity rebate for New South Wales is $250 per year. So, that $250, will that come on his bill? Or will he have to collect it from the? Nah, he's already given the concession card, so the system will match the card and put it on the bill. Oh, so it comes on the bill. Yeah, that's why we ask him for the card number. So, the system checks the card, if the card matches next week, then it'll come on the next bill. So, you'll get a discount like $62, six times. So, the next bill will be what, three months time? Probably August, yeah. In August, is it? Yeah. Okay. Okay, so it's all done. All done now. Yeah, I might get it done for this afternoon. Thanks a lot. And your name? My name's Satish. Satish, Satish, let me say thank you. Alright, thanks for that. Thanks for your help, you've been very helpful. Nah, it's okay, we'll get us ordered. Wait for the, at the flat? No, no, I asked them earlier, if there's clear access to the meter, you don't have to be there. As long as there's no fence, dog, gate, anything blocking it, they're coming out to reconnect you this afternoon. So, as long as there's nothing blocking the meter, they should be fine. Yeah, because the meter box is upstairs, so they can unlock it, isn't it? Yeah, that's correct. Normally, they have the master key, it's not a private lock. Everyone moving in and out, they can't wait for you guys. Normally, in the apartment blocks, they have their own master key. But what I'll do, just stay there, is on the ticket, because I haven't keyed it in yet, I'll just put your name and contact number in case anything, I'll just say any issues, call you out. I'll put that on the ticket, just in case. It's not call me, any issues, call Mr. Mukta. You sure? Just call him? Yeah, yeah. I'll just say call Mukta, his English is fine. I'll just say, go out this afternoon, and I'll put in brackets, if any access issues, call Mukta on this number, so I'll put that in the ticket as well. Yeah, Mukta as well. Yeah. Because he's going to be around, I'm not going to be out. Cool. I'm just going to give him a name, I have to check if there's any building issues. Yeah. I'm leaving now. Well done. Okay. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Thanks. Okay, see you. Thanks for that. Alright. It's been very helpful. That's okay. I appreciate it. Thank you, bye. That's okay. See you.
