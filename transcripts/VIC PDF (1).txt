Hello. Hi Irene, my name's Rose, I'm just calling from First Energy. A quick call, is this a good time? Yeah, it's okay. Perfect. Can I just confirm your last name and date of birth? House 4160. I'll just let you know, call be recorded for quality and coaching purposes. Have you received the forms? No, I've had other mail from you. I've got mail last Wednesday or Thursday stating my payment plan that I put it up to $120 a fortnight. And I got one yesterday saying I owe $3000 now. I'm thinking how can that be? That'll be your new invoice, but you are still on a payment plan. But yeah, your new overdue balance is $2989. Okay, well why did I get one yesterday saying I owe $3000? You must have made a payment recently, let me check. Yeah, I did last week. Yeah, so there's also another payment came through on the 19th. Okay. Yeah, $120. But with the forms... No, I haven't got nothing in the mail yet. See, we had a public holiday here Friday as well. Okay, maybe we'll just try and call you back on Monday, actually Friday if that's okay to see if you're going. Yeah, that's okay, yeah. Okay, so you recently went through all your entitlements, concessions there. Look, I'll let you go and we'll call you back on Friday. Alright then. Thank you, bye. Alright, bye.
