First energy through to Pooja, how can I help? Oh yes, I just got a phone call about paying a bill. Do you want my name? I don't think I need that. I'll try to actually pull up your details using your phone. Yeah, I think I did. I just did. I just speak to you. I mean to go Sandra. No, I didn't. I mean, okay. No, I know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, right. So just wanted to let you know that this call will be recorded for coaching and quality purposes. I hope that's okay with you. Yep, that's fine. Yep. All good. Awesome. May I get you to confirm your full name, date of birth and the property address, please? Yes, it's Sandra Margaret Float, 25th of the 5th, 59. It's 35 Gatehouse Place, Maribyrnong 3032. We had an outstanding of $200.66. Yep. It was paid. Oh, okay. And it hasn't gone through. Sorry. Oh, okay. Okay. So it was paid, but it hasn't gone through. No, it was paid ages ago. Weeks ago. Ages ago? Well, it was paid. I'm at the beach house. My son paid it. So it's under my son's name. It would have come in from the Commonwealth Bank. I don't understand why it hasn't cleared. When was the payment made, Sandra? Sorry? When was the payment made? I'm just waiting for Alex to contact me now. I reckon it was made a couple of weeks ago. It was paid. And it's not the first time we're having trouble with this payment. Yep. Can I request you, I know it's a bit of a hassle, but if you could just go back to the transaction, check the account number that you have used while making this payment, it'll be easier for us to chase that payment. It has definitely not come into the account. That's what I can assure you. Just give me the account number. Just give me the account number and I'll check with Alex. 318-903. That's the bank that it goes into? That's the billing account? No, that's your customer number. That's your account number. So if he has paid via BPAY, has he? Yes. I'll find out if it's BPAY, whichever one. If he has paid via BPAY, there would be an extra digit at the end and I'll just let you know. Extra digit at the end would be 2. I may have forgotten that. Why is that? Extra digit at the end would be 2. Okay. He may have got the right digit 2. This is not the first time we've had it, so maybe he's forgetting the digit. Don't stress. If he has made the payment, we're happy to allocate it to the account, but it's just that we need to get to the bottom of it. Yeah, okay. I'll get back to one of you and see what's happened, because I may not have done that digit. Okay, thank you. We will look for your call. Okay, thanks a lot. Bye. Bye.
