So just to confirm, I'm ringing you up because you want to bring your gas back to First Energy because it's been signed up by another company, correct? Correct, that's right. OK, yep. And like I said to you earlier, your old account that you left us on has got an 8831 credit. I'll get that transferred across to the new account on Monday, OK? Thanks, thank you. Now, yeah, I'll get it done for you. Now what I'll do is, well I've got you here first of all. Can I just confirm your concession card number? Yes. CRN 306 727 940T. Yeah, that's all we have. And can I get the issue date please? Issued 26th of August, 2022. Yeah, that's all we have as well. Excellent. And just the end date, expiry date. And when does it end? 31st of January 2024. Excellent. That's looking good so far, so thanks for your patience. And what I'll do now is, yep, can I just confirm your Medicare card number please? My new care card? Medicare card, yeah. Oh yes. 3171 34498 and then a 1. OK. And what's the number next to your name? A 1. Thank you. Is it a blue or green card? A green card. And just the month and year of the expiry date please? 10th of 2026. Now, one thing I was going to ask you, you know on your concession card, Ross, have you got a middle name or initial printed on that card? No. Excellent. So just Ross MacTeer on the card. Yes, Ross J MacTeer. Aha, J. Thank you. That's what I wanted. Now, two more things before I read the scripting. Your guest usage, would you classify yourself as a small, medium or large user? Oh, well I'm a widower. There's one person in this house, so I presume I'm small. Small. Yes, fine. Let me get it done for you and then I'll read the scripting. It won't get all done for you. OK. So I've got my scripting ready and it's Ross J MacTeer. So can I start slowly reading the scripting out to you? It'll take about five or seven minutes. All right. Thank you. So like I said, my name's Satish from First Energy. Just letting you know, this call is being recorded for quality and compliance purposes. Now, Ross, before we proceed, can you confirm, do you have any type of medical equipment at your property for life support? No. No. Excellent. Thank you. And are you the authorised person to enter a contract for this property? For example, your name may be currently on the bill? Yes, I am. Thank you. Excellent. Now, based on the information you provided in our assessment for the gas, we can offer you the first Saver Plus product. All amounts quoted are inclusive of GST. We can offer you the first Saver Plus product for your gas. Based on an average consumption of 92 megajoules a day, the estimated value of your gas supply before the pay on time discount will be $1,534. The pay on time discount is estimated at $37. This means the estimated yearly spend will be $1,496, including the pay on time discount. Now, Ross, don't worry about those figures. They're just estimates. They're not an actual figure. Yes. Yeah, but you're a small user. Now, would you like to hear your rates now? Do I want to hear my rates? Yes, the new rates. Would you like to hear the rates now? Oh, yes. I won't remember them though. Oh, that's okay. I'll read them out to you and then also advise you your rates will be set up in your welcome pack for your review. So at the end of this call, I'll get them emailed out to you as well. Okay? Oh, good. Thanks. Yeah, so the supply charge is $1.01 today. Yes. And then you have the three blocks for the gas, depending on how much gas you use. So the first 100 megajoules a day is classified as block one. Yes, right. From the next 100 up to the 225 megajoules is classified as block two. Yes. And once you go over that 225, it's block three. So the welcome pack will show you the different blocks as well. So I'll give you the rates anyway, all including GST. For the block one, it's 3.366 cents a megajoule. Yes. Your block two is 3.267 cents a megajoule. And the final block is 2.673 cents a megajoule. So basically, you'll see on the welcome pack, in winter, if you use a bit more gas, the more gas you use, the rates get cheaper on the blocks. But like I said to you, once I finish this call, I'm going to transfer the balance on the old account to the new one, then I'll get the rates sent out to you as well. Okay? Thank you. Okay, now, the key terms and conditions of our first several plus product is a market retail contract with ongoing benefits, no fixed term and no excess fee for the supply of electricity with First Energy, which comes with a 7% guaranteed discount off your gas usage charges and a 3% pay on time discount off your gas usage charges, which is 10% in total. And that is for, just to confirm this with you, the MIRN, which is your gas meter number, of 533 0558 7777 for 14 Kandara Way, Kennington, Victoria, 3550. Now, to receive your pay on time discount, you must pay the bill in full by 5pm on the due date. Now, Ross, would you like to receive your bill and other communications from First Energy via email or post? Emails are good, yes. Yeah, I've got rvmctier at gmail.com, is that correct? No, no, rjomctier. Oh, okay, I better change it on the system. We've got rv, hang on. Yes, well, my wife died. I'll get a change for you right now. That's why I said when I call you back I have to confirm all your details. So thanks for that. Let's have a look. I should have told you. No, that's okay. I'll get a fix for you right now. Stay there. rjomctier. At gmail.com? Pardon? It's still the same address. Oh, thank you. Let's have a look. Yes, I'm here. Gmail.com. rjomctier.com. So I'm just confirming the email address is rjomctier at gmail.com, is that correct? Correct, yes. Excellent. First Energy will send you a monthly bill via email and send you any notices and communications electronically. If we need to post anything, can I just confirm 14 Canderaway, Kennington, Victoria, 3550 is your best post address? Yes, that's right. Thank you. I'm just double checking something on the system. Give me two minutes. I just want to make sure that I've changed your email address correctly. I don't want the email going to the wrong account. No, no. While I've got you here, shall I just check your electricity account to make sure that's all correct as well? Oh, that's good. I'll just double check everything. I'd rather check everything now so we don't have any issues later. Yes, good. Oh, no, you're right. Your electricity account has been changed to the correct email. That was good. I was just making sure. All right, good. Now for gas, because we're billing you monthly when no actual read is available, we'll estimate your gas bill. Your initially estimated gas bills will be based on the average use by a comparable customer, which is estimated at $1,200 per annum and adjusted for the change in usage over winter and summer. If we calculate your estimated gas bill too high or too low, this will be automatically adjusted on your next bill after we receive an actual read for your meter. So far, Ross, do you have any questions? No, none. No questions. I'm going to ask you this one line and then I just need a clear yes or no. I'll finish reading out the scripting. So Ross, would you like to proceed with entering into a contract with First Energy as your new energy retailer and understand this is not a request for information only? All right. Yes. Yes. Okay. So what I'll do, Ross, I'll ask you again. Basically what I'm doing is I'm asking for your permission if I can set the new gas account up. So there's no lock-in contract. There's no exit fees. But in Victoria, they're quite strict. So every call they do listen to. So it just has to be a clear yes or no from the customer. So I'll just ask you slowly. And if you could give me a clear yes or no, I can start reading it out to you. So Ross, would you like to proceed with entering into a contract with First Energy as your new energy retailer and understand this is not a request for information only? Yes. Yes. That'll be all right. Okay. I'll ask you again, Ross. It just has to be a clear yes or no. That's all I need. Oh, I see. No, that's okay. Take your time. Don't worry. I'll read it out to you slowly and just a clear yes, then I can start. Or no. So just a clear yes or no from you, then I can start reading the other part out. So Ross, would you like to proceed with entering into a contract with First Energy as your new energy retailer and understand this is not a request for information only? Yes. Thank you. That's great. So in order to transfer you into a contract, I'm confirming your full name is Ross McTeer and the 13th of January 1940 is your date of birth. Is that correct? Correct. And 0412031373 is your date of birth. Is that correct? 13th of the 1st, 1940. Yeah, your mobile number I'm confirming now. So 0412031373. Is that correct? Yes. And I'm just confirming again because it's all being recorded now, so stay there. Where is your ID? And for the ID, you gave me a green Medicare card which expires on the 10th, so October 2026 of 3171344981 and your number one on the card. Is that correct? Correct. Excellent.

Yeah, we're getting there. Thank you. I will now read for you an important statement which I would like you to listen carefully to and your consent is required at the end. Today's date is the 19th of May 2023. That's about six paragraphs, Ross, so I'll go slowly. You provide your explicit informed consent to enter a market retail contract with First Energy and are currently the primary account holder authorised to enter this contract.

First Energy may also contact you for quality assurance or order purposes and to check if you have questions. Now, just like before, Ross, just about done, I need a clear yes or no on this last question then I'll get the ball rolling. Do you accept the terms and conditions you have just heard and consent to enter an agreement with First Energy? I do. Okay. I'll have to ask you again, it has to be a clear yes or no. So do you accept the terms and conditions you have just heard and consent to enter an agreement with First Energy? Yes. Excellent. Now, because you have a concession card, I will now play for you an important statement about you providing consent for First Energy to confirm your concession card agilability. With regard to your concession, you authorise First Energy to use Centrelink confirmation e-services to perform an enquiry of your Centrelink or Department of Veterans Affairs customer details and concession card status to enable the business to determine if you qualify for a concession, rebate or service. The Australian Government Department of Human Services to provide the results of that enquiry to First Energy. You understand that the Department will disclose personal information to First Energy, including your name, address, payment type, payment status and concession card type and status to confirm your agilability for your concession or rebate. This consent remains valid while you are a customer of First Energy unless you withdraw it by contacting First Energy or the Department. You can get proof of your circumstances and details from the Department and provide to First Energy so your agilability for your concession can be determined. If you withdraw your consent or do not alternatively provide proof of your circumstances and details, you may not be eligible for the concession to be provided by First Energy. So basically, what that means, we just ask for your permission to get your card checked and you told me, sorry, it was Ross J. McTeer on the card, correct? Yes. Yeah, so just two more lines and it's all done. I'm sure in Victoria, I have to read this out to you in Victoria. If you're happy to be contacted about First Energy offers and promotions at a later date, I have one last consent to capture. Do you agree that First Energy may contact you by any means in accordance with its privacy policy about its energy offers and promotions even after your contract ends? Oh yes, yes. Yeah, that's all done. All done. I'll set up the new account. I'm going to email the confirmation out to you and like I said, when you get your first bill, have a look on the opening balance. There will be the $88.31 credit that I've transferred across for you. Thank you very much for your help. All done. Thank you. You have a good day. Bye. Thanks a lot. No worries. Thank you.
