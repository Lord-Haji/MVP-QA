First Energy Wing speaking, how can I help you today? Yeah, hi, look, you just sent me a message about a disconnection notice. Yep. I don't have my account number and stuff on me right now. Mm-hmm. I'll have a look and see if I can find it. Yep. I'm doing a search of your phone number, see what comes up. I won't be too long. Yep. I brought up an account. Can I confirm your full name and date of birth and your address, please? Yeah, it's Carol Marzook. Date of birth is 21-10-1975. And what's your address? Oh, yeah, I'm in Holstings Drive, Mill Park. Okay, so I'm just having a look. Can I confirm the state and postcode? Yeah, Victoria 3082. No worries. So there's a balance in this account here that I'm looking at. This is in particular to be electricity. There's $693.20 overdue. Yep. Yep. Okay. So I paid $150 just a couple of days ago. So I don't know, can I organise, like, you know, a payment plan or...? Sure. So I don't believe we received the payment of $150 a few days ago. It may be for the gas. I'm going to have a quick look at that. The gas itself is actually $234.63 overdue as well. And this one does have the payment of $150. So let's talk about the electricity first, and then we'll talk about the gas in a moment. So if you're looking for a payment plan for the electricity, the way the payment plan works, the system generates an amount based off your usage consumption and your debt outstanding on the account. So in this consideration, do you want to do a weekly or fortnightly? Probably fortnightly. So on a fortnightly basis, there are six instalments here. The system is showing the amount that you should pay is about $155 a fortnight. Is that something you can do? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just thought $150 was the electricity. I must have made a mistake when I was paying. Okay. So in this case, I'll set up the arrangement for $155 a fortnight for the electricity. When can you make your first payment on this new plan? So it would have to be... I can start from next week. Next week, when would that be? Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday? So when I get paid, it will be on the Thursday. So you want to do it on the Thursday, or you want to do it on the Friday? What do you want to do? Yeah, it looks like I'll just do Friday. Okay. So I just want to clarify here because of the way the payment plan works, you need to make sure the first payment is on the Friday. The payment after that is fine if you want to do it a little bit early, but the first payment needs to be on the Friday. On the Friday, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yep. Yep. Okay. So that's been set up. So that's the 2nd of June 2023, next week, Friday. And will you be making the payment yourself, or do you require direct debit for this? No, I'll be doing that myself. No worries then. So that's fine. So it was $100... $155. $155. Yep. And let's look at your gas account. Do you need an arrangement for that one, or what's the situation for the gas? So you've set up the $150 towards the gas, $200 towards the electricity. That was for the electricity. $155 is for electricity. Yeah, yeah, I know. I made a payment a few days ago for $150. Was that towards gas, or...? That went to the gas. That went to the gas. Oh, that went to the gas. Okay. So how much is still available? How much do I still have to pay? So the balance on the gas is $234.63. Are you looking for another arrangement for this one? No, that's alright. I'll pay that as soon as I can. When is that? So just flag it on the account. Yeah, so I can probably do that next week as well. Next week? So what I'll do is I'll extend the balance to next week, so as long as you pay the full balance by next week for the gas, that should be fine. Okay. Alright. Next week would be, what, Friday? Yeah, yeah, Friday. Sure. That's been done then. That's been set up. I just want to confirm here, we're talking about your payment assistance entitlements? Yeah, yeah. Sure? Yeah. In regards to the payment assistance entitlements, I'd just like to confirm to you where, when, and give areas your various payment assistance entitlements, including a flexible payment arrangement, assistance in access in government and non-government support services, up-to-date information, up-to-date usage, electricity saving tips, lower future energy costs, re-ruining energy rights, guarantor of access to financial counselling, and placing your views on holding circumstances. Do you understand all the entitlements, and you can contact First Energy if your circumstances change? Yes, yes. No worries, and that's okay, since that's all been done, anything else I can help you with? No, that's good, that's all. No worries, thank you very much for attending. Have a good day. Thank you.
