This is Joanne. How can I help you today? Hey Joanne, my name's Chris. Let's do a quick query about my inbox. So what information do you need from me? I've got my customer number or the inbox number. Can I grab the customer number please? Easy, 334-514. Alrighty, so I'll just ask some ID questions if that's okay. Can I please confirm your first name and last name? Christopher James Wilson. And what's the date of birth I'd have for you? 10th of December, 91. May I please confirm your mobile phone number? 0426-238-974. Okay, is there a concession card on this account, yes or no? No. And the last question is optional. This one you can say no to. Can I send a six digit code to your mobile phone and have you read that back to me? Sure. There you go, thank you. That's just the spoofed phone number and AI call check. Internet, thanks. I want to pad my bills if I can. 369-110. Perfect, thank you so much. Alrighty, so I'll just open up a copy of the bill and we can go over it. Alright, can I get a new bill issued next Wednesday? When you say a new bill issued, is it because you feel that the charges are wrong or? No, no, I've got one of my, I've got a mate staying with me and just so it's a bit easier, he's moving out next week. So just so we can split it more evenly, I was wondering if you could reissue the bill next Wednesday, or yeah, next Wednesday. Okay, having a look here, I don't think that's something we can do. It looks like you've, yeah, it looks like you've got a smart meter and we're on a fairly rigid billing cycle, so we would only be able to do our bills once a month, I'm sorry. No, no, that's all good. I guess my next question is, I get paid next Thursday. I know the due date of the current invoice is the 16th, or the 17th, I'm not too sure. Can we extend that to the 18th and I'll have it paid then? Yeah, definitely, that's easy as pie. Yeah, and how is, like, seeing this as my first payment, is it an automatic payment or do I just de-pay it just for future reference? I'll just see if you've got a direct debit set up. I don't think I do from memory, but do you guys have any, like, dishonor fees or anything like that? We only have dishonor fees when there's a direct debit set up, which you don't. Do you mean late fees? Yeah, oh, like late fees and dishonor fees and all that kind of stuff. Just like on top of things before it happens. We don't do late fees. If you were to have a direct debit set up and the payment failed, then there would most likely be a dishonor fee, but never a late fee. All right, cool. So, all right, well, I don't have it in place, so that doesn't apply to me. I'll make sure to have it all paid up by the 18th next week. But when's my next invoice going to be issued? Probably around about the 1st of June, give or take a few days. All right, cool, cool. I will let you know that in Victoria, if we extend bills, Victoria is very strict and I have to read out a script just because they want to make sure all Victorian customers are notified of every financial aid and assistance option an electricity provider should provide. Is that okay? Yeah, go for it. I'll for a tune-out, but that's fine. All good. I'll just pop in, there's a form that they make us fill out as well, so quickly do that. Pop in your contact info. We get audited, yay. I guess you have to do the same old stuff every other day, right? Yeah. How long is the script? Not very long. At least that's good. How many times a day do you have to do it? Oh, you know, it really depends. If it's the winter time, we tend to have to do it maybe three or four times a day because winter bills are awful, as I'm sure you'd well know. Summer, not as regularly, unless they're Queensland customers. Oh, because they've got the AC on all the time. Oh yeah. It's too hot in Melbourne, so I understand. Yeah. So the financial counsellor assistance information number is 1800 007 007. The government rebate for Victorian customers, if they qualify, is the Utility Relief Grant Scheme. Energy saving tips and flexible payment options are available on the First Energy website. And I'd just like to confirm, so you're aware, when you have arrears, you have various payment assistance entitlements, including a flexible payment arrangement, assistance in accessing government and non-government support services, up-to-date information to help monitor usage, a list of energy saving tips to lower your future energy costs. Concession rebates are available if you have a valid concession card, which doesn't apply, reviewing your energy rates and guidance on how to access a financial counsellor, as well as placing your arrears on hold in certain circumstances. Do you understand all of your entitlements and they can contact First Energy if your circumstances change? Yeah. Well, what's the Utility Grant Scheme? So the Utility Relief Grant Scheme is where if you have a valid concession card, the Victorian... But... Yeah, the Victorian government will give you $650 toward each utility, so that's separate $650 for gas, electricity and water. And if you find yourself in financial hardship, you can apply to use all of it or some of it over a two-year period. And then after the end of that two-year period, it kickstarts again. All right, cool. Well, what have you here? You know that about powerbonus? Yeah. Do you have your 50? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Am I only applicable for one household? Or what if I pay the bills for two households? Am I applicable twice? That I am not entirely sure. Bear with me. Let's see if I can find out. I guess the worst I can do is apply twice, right? Yeah. Let's go on to the... Compare Energy 250. Okay, so it just says eligible households. It doesn't say any... It just says only one payment per household available under each round. All right, easy. All right. I appreciate it. And I'll sort everything out for the A-team. I appreciate all the help. No worries at all. You too. Take care. You too. Bye-bye. Bye.
