This call is being recorded. If you do not wish to be recorded, please disconnect at this time. Hi, welcome to First Energy. Speaking to Carl, how may I help you? Oh, hi, Carl. This is Phoebe. Just wondering if you could provide some information regarding a solar feeding array, because I'm currently with Aurora and I've got two properties, both with Aurora. And if I would like to switch to the First Energy, how much, what is the best way that you guys can offer? I can certainly take that. Just letting you know, this call is being recorded for quality and compliance purposes. May I have your first name? Phoebe. And Phoebe, what is your, have you got an NMI number for those two properties? What is that number? Sorry. It will be on your Aurora bill. It will be mentioned as NMI. NMI. I'll have a look. Just a second. It starts with eight. Yeah, take your time. It starts with eight. NMI. Oh, yes. Can you hear me? Yes, I can. Yeah. So it's eight. Yeah. Double zero. Yep. Double zero. Yep. Six, double eight. Yep. Double seven, nine. Thank you. So that's one of the meter, what you gave me. So you've got two meters, you said, with Aurora, correct? No, another property. I mean, both properties are with Aurora, but another property doesn't have any solar seeding rates. And I'm just wondering, of course, if I'm switching to First Energy with the solar system, of course, I would like to have the other property coming with as well. So, yes, but first I would like to see what is the offer that you guys can give. So 189 Madden Street, Davenport, Tasmania 7310, is that the address for this meter? Yes. And this has got solar panels, correct? Yes. Yes. OK. So the solar feed-in, what you get from us is... Yeah, sorry. Go ahead. Sorry. We have like 20 panels on the rooftop. And what is the inverter size? Do you know, Phoebe? Not quite sure, but we've got 20 panels. So is there any standard inverter with this number of panels? So it's a... No, no. If you can have any number of panels, that's fine. But with the solar feed-in, what we offer is 10 cents. You get 10 cents from us with First Energy. 10 cents. Yep. Yep. And you've got a daily supply charge on this meter, which will be 97.9 cents per day with First Energy. And what you've got there with Aurora? Is it on the bill or not? Yeah, on the bill. I'm pretty much sure we are cheaper, but I just want to compare for your understanding, that's all. And then we can go from there. So... I don't know where can I look for this information? It'll be on the second page, the last page of your invoice, where they calculate your bill. Yes. There they'll put it as service to the property charge and the usage charge. The usage charge. Yes, this is where it shows the standard tariff. There's the lights and power, stuff like that. Yep. So is it tariff 31? Does it show as tariff 31 there? Yes, there's tariff 31, yes. Yep. What is the charge? Because your usage, they multiply into their charges. What do they charge you on that? It will be like 0.2 something. Oh yes, so it's 27.6. Yeah, 27.6 something, correct? Yes. Ours is cheaper, which is 27.28 cents for the power and light per kilowatt hour, including GST. I guess with yours... So how about your 93? If I would like to switch to tariff 93? Yeah, we can organize that as well. If you want to go for tariff 93 peak and off-peak times, so we can organize it. So first I'm just checking whether this has got a smart meter here. It won't be long. Let me check that first. So 9... 9. Okay, yes, this has got a smart meter. So we can change to tariff 93, which is peak and off-peak usage if you'd like to have that way. So there won't be any charge involved for changing your tariff on this for you. But with your current rates, you've got only single rate. If you see the Aurora bill, you've got just the one tariff, which is power and light. That is 27.6 what you're paying. Ours is 27.28, which we are cheaper. And what is the service to the property? They mention as like 97 or what is it? 98.93. Yeah, ours is 97.9 cents per day, which is still we are cheaper. And the solar feed-in, what you're getting is 8.888 from them, correct? Yes. Ours is 10 cents. We offer more solar on here, which is 10 cents. So basically, if you look up the overall use rate charge and the solar feed-in, we are cheaper than Aurora on this meter for you. Yeah. So is this the best offer, even if I am like switching with two properties? I can also, because the other property, you said you don't have solar panels, correct? The other one? Yes. What is the address of the other property? 130, Gola Road. 130, yeah. Yes. And how do you spell the road name? G-A-W-L-E-R. And the postcode on it? 7315. Thank you. We have got a different offer for you on this one. Are you a member of RACT3B? I am not quite sure. I don't think I am. Okay. We have got one more offer for you on this one. Yes. Where you get a $50 credit after six months, you stay with us, and you get one more $50 credit after 12 months. So it is like $100 credits for the first year, you get it from us, for the other one. This is for the first year. Is that right? Yes. So can I get the NMI number for the other property? Can you check what is the NMI number for the other one? Now, hold on a sec, please. Pick a time period. That is fine. Thank you. Yeah. All good. Right. It is 800-00-625-780. 800-00-625-780. Perfect. So since you don't have solar panels on this property, we can offer you a different plan for this one. Since you are switching to meters, we can offer that $100 credits for the first year on this meter, where you get $50. Again, still cheaper on the actual rates when you compare with Aurora, because you have got a peak and off-peak on this one for you. So the peak usage with Aurora, I guess they are charging you 33-point-something, if you look up there. 33.39. Yeah, 33.39. Ours is 33 cents even. We are still cheaper than them. And off-peak, I guess you are getting charged like 15-point- 55. 55. Yeah. Ours is 15.29 cents per kilowatt hour. Yeah. We are cheaper than them. And the daily supply charge, what you are getting from them is 1.099. Is that right? Yes. Ours is 1.0879 dollar per day, including GST. These are all. And on top of that, we offer the $100 credits for the first year. If you stay with us, you get a $50 credit after six months, and you get one more $50 credit after 12 months. So I can offer that. Since you do not have solar panels, I will get that offer done for the other meter, if you are happy to switch both. So do you mean like for both properties, I will be able to enjoy the $100 credit for the third? No, the other property, you will get 10 cents for the feed-in for you. So since, yeah, since you are bringing the one more property, I am offering the $100 credits for the first year. For the other one, 130 Gollar Road, I am offering that. Since you are bringing that, I am offering the other offer for you. But for the one in 189, the one with the solar panel, we just have a better- Yeah, you get more feed-in. You do not get any credits, but you get more feed-in for 10 cents on that plan for you. And the other one, you will get, since you do not have solar panels, there is no point in giving you solar. So I will give you $100 credits for the first year for you. Okay. Okay. So how long does it take to switch to the tariff for the property? Since you already got the solar panel, sorry, smart meter on the other one, so after your 10 business day cooling off period, we will get the account switched from Aurora to First Energy. From that time, it takes a maximum of 10 business days to get the, 10 to 11 business days to get the tariff change to 93 for you. Okay. And you said there is no charge if I switch to First Energy? Yeah, there is no charge. There is no transfer fees because both have got smart meters. Aurora does not charge you anything or we charge you anything on the transfer for you. Okay. Okay.
