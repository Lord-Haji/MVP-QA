Hello. Hello, am I speaking with Mark? Yeah, how can I help you? Hi, this is Karima calling from First Energy. Is it a good time? Oh, First Energy, okay. Yes, how are you today? Good? I'm good, thank you. Before we go further, on the call, can I verify you in the account, please? Your full name and date of birth? Yep, Mark Armstrong, 3rd A1. And the full address with the state and postcode? 33 Parklands Pride, New Zealand and Tasmania. And the postcode? You there? You there? Yeah, I'm there. I'm just looking for the postcode. Yeah, that's fine. I'm just getting your stuff posted up a little bit. And how can I help you? My payment needs to be done, does it? I'm just going down to sort my bank out. It's because my pay didn't go in at the right time. Okay. Yeah, I'm just going down now to do it. I'm actually just getting just to get it right down to the bank. And yeah, do that. So I will transfer a payment over. What is it? 140, isn't it? There have been dishonoured payments, more than two dishonoured payments on your account because of insufficient funds. Right. Yeah, so the last one was attempted on 17th and it was dishonoured. Even before that on 3rd May, that was also dishonoured, I think, because of insufficient funds. So there's two payments I've missed, is it? I'm just checking that for you. It wouldn't be long. Yeah, so I need to pay 280. Is that right? Yeah, I'm just checking that. Yeah, one payment came through. So you have made another... Oh, I'm just checking which... This is also dishonoured. So yeah, just one payment came through from your hardship payment plan. So the rest two are dishonoured. So that will be 140. 140. So if I go down now to the bank and could you do me a favour? Sure, yes. And send me the BPAY details to this number? Is it possible to send it on your email ID? No, not at the moment because I haven't got my proper phone. I've got a sub phone at the moment. And I can't get into my bank. So that's what I'm doing now. I'm going down to put my bank thing on. Do you have a pen and paper handy? Because I'm not able to send an SMS through my system at the moment. Yeah, give me two seconds and I'll find a pen and paper. Sure, take your time. I can't take this on. We're in a hurry. I've got to make the bank. I'll stay blurry. Right, OK. Now hit me with it. One second. I'm just opening your last invoice. So the bill of code is 878876. And your reference number is 2954. Ref number 2954. Yep, sorry. And the 878876 number, what was that? Bill of code. That's the bill of code, OK. Yeah, and the reference number is not complete. So it's 2954865. 2954865. Yeah, that's correct. That's your reference number. 865. Yeah. OK, very good. I'll go down to the bank now. And what did I have to do to put 240, was it? 141 and 141 is 296. Sorry, sorry, sorry. My bad. 282. Yeah, yeah, that's correct. 282. Sorry. My bad. 141 and 141 would be 282. 282, yeah, yeah, sorry. I was in a hurry. I know you're afraid of your job. No, no, no. I know. I'm so sorry. My mistake. I apologise. No, don't be. Don't do it. But hey, do you know what? It's Friday afternoon. Yeah. And you've got a great excuse. Yeah, I agree. Can't wait to finish. Yeah, it's time to knock off and go and enjoy your weekend. What have you got planned? Nothing much. I'll just, till I have work to finish. So I'll quickly finish this call. You have an active concession coming from your concession card. And you want me to offer you payment assistance entitlements before you finish. Yeah. OK. So I would just like, you want me to discuss the entitlements? Sorry, all the entitlements for what? The payment assistance, like the same hardship plan and everything. Yeah, how do I get that? I would just like to confirm so you're aware when you have arrears or debt on the account, you have various payment assistance entitlements. It's like a flexible payment plan arrangement. Like you are on one right now. Assistance in assessing government and non-government support services. Up to date information to help monitor usage. A list of energy saving tips to lower your future energy cost. Reviewing your energy rates and guidance on how to access a financial counsellor. Do you understand all your entitlements and that you can contact First Energy if your circumstances change? Just hold on a few seconds. I might hang up. If it hangs up, can you please ring me back? OK. Thank you. Yep. I'll just put in my earphones. I've got to drive. Sure, sure, sure. Hang on. Are you there still? I'm still there. Very good. Right now we might go to, where is it, Bluetooth. How do you go to Bluetooth? My call is almost finished, Mark. The last thing I need to confirm is your direct debit has been stopped. Do you want me to restart that one? That's it. Yes, please. Yep. OK, sure. That's it. I'll go down to 282 in. Yep. Yep. I've restarted your direct debit for the next payment. Yep. Yep. Thank you. All done. Not a problem. And, yeah, just for the bank, because my bank probably didn't have the money in there at the time. Sure, sure. I'll mind my AIB payments at the moment. So that 282 you'll be putting through BPAY, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK, that's fine. That's fine. Thank you. All done. Take care. Drive safe. Bye. Bye. Thank you.
