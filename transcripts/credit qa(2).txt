First I'm going to speak to Isaac, how may I help? Hi, my name's Annette Baker, I'm just looking for my handbag to get the bill. I'm just ringing about an overdue bill. Yep, yep. No worries, let's have a look. Do you know your customer number or your account number with us? That's what I'm just looking for. Oh, okay, that's alright. One sec. No worries. Found it. Customer, that's up the top, isn't it? That's right, yep, in the blue box. Yep. I have to go outside, it's too cold inside. Right here, in the blue box. And your customer number is 231-689. Yep. I'll just need to do a quick identification. Can I just grab your full name and your date of birth? The full name is Annette Reader-Baker and date of birth is the 12th of the 7th, 63. Thank you. And the address that you have with us, including the state and the postcode? 17 Ocean Street, North Haven, New South Wales, 2443. Thank you. Just need to let you know the call will be recorded for call and engage purposes. So, the overdue balance on the account as of today is $986.08. I just got a letter yesterday saying they're going to cut me power off. But, yeah, I can pay $400 on Friday through eBay. Yeah, okay. And I've made an appointment with an agency in Port Macquarie and that's not until the 14th of June. And they will help me pay some of it and then whatever's left I can pay. Ah, fantastic. Yep. So, you'll pay $400 tomorrow, is that what I'm hearing? Yes. Okay. No worries. Let me just have a look. So, I'll note it down in the account that you'll make a payment tomorrow. And so, because you've made contact as well in response to that disconnection notice, you won't be at a risk of any disconnection. And I can note it down here that you've got an appointment scheduled as well. Which agency will you be going to, if you don't mind me asking? It's Port Macquarie Neighbourhood Centre. No worries. Yeah. Yep. And, yeah, so they usually give you about $300, I think. So, I'll still owe $200 and something. Yep. Okay. After they've applied to me for vouchers. Okay. That's all good. I can note that down. Yeah, so just ensure to make the payment tomorrow. And then if you'd like, you can either just let us know that you've made payment by calling us and providing a sort of payment transaction or presenting in a screenshot of the payment, if you'd like. But I've noted it down on your account that you will make a payment tomorrow. So, you're more than welcome to sort of give us a call later after we've sort of made that payment. Now, what I would recommend is due to the fact that that appointment is more than sort of a month away, Annette, after you've made the $400 payment tomorrow, maybe give us a call in the following week to sort of set up a temporary payment plan for a smaller amount. You know, because just to sort of keep it going, just to sort of have some consistency between the timeframe of sort of now and that appointment. Just to sort of make minimal payments towards it, just so that there's some consistency through there. Because it is a bit of a longer time to sort of wait out for the utility service itself for longer than two to three weeks. And so just give us a call back and then we can sort of assist you with a payment plan, a temporary sort of payment plan based, sort of tailored to your situation and also sort of an amount that is comfortable and manageable up until that time. Okay. So, make sure to do that and then we'll sort of note it down. And then, yeah, that should all be fine. I'm just going to check your account just to make sure all of the sort of, you're receiving all of the sort of benefits. Based on your most recent invoice, I can see your concession card is coming off the account. And so those are being applied through already. And did you want to go through your other payment difficulty or financial entitlements today, Annette? What's that? Yeah. So, I'd just like to confirm, so you're aware we need to have arrears. You have various other payment assistance entitlements as well, such as a flexible payment plan, assistance from government and non-government support services, information to help monitor usage, energy saving tips, reviewing energy rates and guidance from a financial counsellor if you ever need. So, it looks like you've really gotten into it, some of those already, such as the government assistance, which is what you'll be looking into at that neighbourhood centre. And then when you give us a call back, you know, we can set up that sort of flexible payment plan for you just as a temporary thing between the timeframe of your appointment and now. Does that sound all right? I don't really have time today to do that. Is that... Yeah, no, no, of course, yeah, not today. So, once you've made the payment, give us a call back. Make sure to give us a call back because you'll sort of keep receiving reminders and notification. And to avoid that, we want to sort of get you on some sort of temporary sort of a small arrangement between that time of the appointment, yeah. Okay. Thank you very much. No worries. Thanks for your time then, Annette. I hope you have a great day. Cheers. Bye. Bye.
