I just have Jack on the line calling regarding account 195924. Yep. So, fully ID'd, he's just been authorised and added to the account as a decision maker. What Eve is with him at the moment as well, he'd like to transfer the account over into his name. Okay. So, I'm not sure, so fully ID'd, no OTP, they were unable to complete that, so Eve's confirmed the address for this one and date of birth. All right, no problem at all. Just bear with me here. All right, put them through. Awesome, sending them over now. Thanks. Hi, good morning. Welcome to First Energy. My name is Varun, am I speaking? Jack? Correct. Hi Jack, how are you doing? Well, hopefully better than mine. After I finish talking to you. All right, now just to let you know, calls are recorded for quality and compliance purposes, Jack, and you just want to take over this account and put it under your name, correct? Correct. Okay, can you just confirm the address you're taking over, please? Then, in the Bali clause, that's my child's name, sorry. Sorry about that. That's okay, no worries. Okay, give me one moment here. All right, now Jack, the last meter reading for this property was done on the 15th of April, so would you like to take over from the 15th of April? So, in that way, there wouldn't be any meter reading that has to be done, if you take over from the future date. Well, the bill I paid lately was, reading was on the 15th of March or something. So, 15th of March until 15th of April, that's your billing cycle? Yeah, correct. So, 15th of April was the meter reading date, so you're happy to take over from the 15th of April, that's what I'm asking. Okay, so when you receive your next bill, that will be under your name. Okay, give me one moment. And also, you are on a very old plan as well. I'm going to offer you a better plan, which is more cheaper. Yeah, okay. So, for example, at the moment, you are getting a pay-on-time discount of 20%. Okay, now, on the current plan, you guys are getting 20% pay-on-time discount. But these rates are a little bit more than what we have now. So, I'm going to change your plan and give you a better offer, which is cheaper than your current plan. Plus, we add your concession details as well, okay? Okay, so shall I give you my concession number? I will take all the details in a while, but just before that, let me change the account under your name first. I have to read out some terms and conditions for the new plan, and then I'll give you the details. Okay, thank you. I have to read out some terms and conditions for the new plan, and then I will put everything under your name, okay? Okay. All right, now just bear with me for a moment. All right, now today's date is the 15th of May, 2023. My name is Varun, as I mentioned earlier. Calls are recorded for quality and compliance purposes. Now, just bear with me. Now, do you have any kind of medical equipment at the property for life support? No. Okay. Do you have any kind of solar panels at the property? No. Okay. And then you have a concession card, you said, yeah? Yes. Okay, perfect. No problem at all. Okay, perfect. No problem at all. So, no solar panels, concession card, yes. No medical equipment, as you mentioned earlier. So, that's all good. All right, now based on the information you have provided and our assessment, we can offer you the first saver product, and I will provide you some information now so that you can make a comparison against the Victorian default offer and understand how much your discount is. Now, all amounts quoted are inclusive of GST. We can offer you the first super saver, sorry, first saver product for your electricity, which is $144 less than the current Victorian default offer. That is also available from First Energy. Now, based on an annual medium user reference consumption of 4000 kilowatt hours per year, the estimated value of your electricity supply before any pre-on-time discount would be $1179 annually, and the guaranteed discount is estimated at $139. Now, Jack, this is just the estimation, not your actual bill. You will only pay as per your usage, okay? Okay. Now, would you like to hear your electricity rates over the phone, or you're happy to get them in your welcome pack by email or by post? I'd rather you send me by mail. Sorry? I'd rather have that rate, which you're proposing, if you can send me by mail. Okay, yeah, perfect. We will be doing that. We will be doing that anyways. You can send me by my email. Yeah, okay, okay. So, we will definitely send it to you. No problem. Now, the key terms and conditions of our first saver product is a market retail contract with ongoing benefits, no fixed term, and no exit fee for the supply of electricity with First Energy, which comes with a 15% guaranteed discount on the usage charges only. So, you are not locked into anything. You can change or cancel anytime you want to, okay? Okay. All right. Now, let me check. Would you like to receive your bills and communications by email or by post? Email? Yes. Okay. Can I give you my email address now? I will take it. Just bear with me. And you're happy with monthly bills, yeah? Yes. Okay, perfect. Now, do you have any questions before I confirm your details? Say it again, sorry. No, I mean, do you have any other questions before I confirm your personal details? No, no, no. Okay. Okay. Now, this is a question for you.

Alright Jack, now do you accept the terms and conditions you've just heard and consent to enter an agreement with First Energy, just a yes or no? Yes, I do. Thanks for that. Now because we are adding your concession card details, I have to play a concession recording as well. It's about you providing consent for First Energy to confirm your concession card eligibility with Centrelink. So I'll just play that and come back again. Thanks. With regards to your concession, you authorise First Energy to use Centrelink confirmation e-services to perform an enquiry of your Centrelink or Department of Veterans Affairs customer details and concession card status to enable the business to determine if you qualify for a concession, rebate or service, and the Australian Government's Department of Human Services to provide the results of that enquiry to First Energy. You understand that the Department will disclose personal information to First Energy, including your name, address, payment type, payment status and concession card type and status to confirm your eligibility for your concession or rebate. This consent remains valid while you're a customer of First Energy, unless you withdraw it by contacting First Energy or the Department. You can get proof of your circumstances and details from the Department and provide it to First Energy so your eligibility for your concession can be determined. If you withdraw your consent or do not alternatively provide proof of your circumstances and details, you may not be eligible for the concession to be provided by First Energy. Alright, thank you for listening to that as well. Now, if you're happy to be contacted about First Energy's offers and promotions, at a later date, I have one last consent to capture, Jack. Do you agree that First Energy may contact you by any means in accordance with its privacy policy about its energy offers and promotions even after your contract ends? Basically, yes, but would I be able to withdraw if I change my mind or something? Yes, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely. Yeah, okay. Alright, that's all done for the day and do you need any help other than this as well? No, I hope that all that complicated transfer is intact and I'm looking forward to receiving your invoice next time. Okay, yeah, yeah. So when you receive your next invoice, which is pretty due I guess this month, you will receive it under your name. Great. Thank you very much for your help. No problem. Thank you so much for your time and you have a good day. You too. Thank you. Bye.
