I'm just ringing up about the new electricity account that I just signed up with you guys with. Yeah. Yeah, I just wanted to cancel it. They said I had a 10 day calling off period. Yeah. Do you have the customer number? I've got an account number. Yeah, what's that? 341882. Yeah. And your full name, address and date of birth? 4th of the 4th, 74. Yeah, and your name? Benny Padula. And the address? The electricity address is 13 Glenrowan Street, Morwell, Victoria 3840. 440. No worries. Thank you. Was there a reason that you are leaving or is there anything we can do rate wise? Yeah, it was just the daily supply charges. Ah, yeah. What I'm paying now. Fair enough. And if you're a small user, then that would make sense. I can't budge on the daily supply charges, so what I'll do is I'll cancel that. And it just means you'll stay with your current retailer, OK? No worries. Thank you very much for that. No worries. That's all done. OK. Thank you. Cheers. Thanks. Bye. OK. Bye.
