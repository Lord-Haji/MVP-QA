First Energy, you're speaking to Isaac, how may I help? Zac, it's Jess from call centre. I just have a power on the line. His customer number is 2505-081. Yep, okay. So he's fully ID'd, not OTP, but we did confirm the email. He's been disconnected for non-payment. I'm just adding the notes to the account now. He has made a payment of the full overdue balance, the $568.49. The receipt number should appear on the account now, the 3383 5857266. So he's just looking to schedule a reconnection if possible. No worries, that's all good. And have you checked for any concession? I don't think he has. Yep, no concession and no life support requirements. Great, no worries. You can put him through. Thank you so much. Trouble at all, transferring now. See ya. Hello, am I speaking to Paul? Yes, yes you're speaking. Hi, my name's Isaac, I've just been transferred over. Now I'm going to say that you made a payment of the overdue balance and then what I will do today is we'll put through a reconnection. So just make sure that the main switch is in the off position and because you have gone through a disconnection, there will be a reconnection fee on your next invoice. And as long as there's no issues with access and there's no issues with the meter box as well, you know, because it is a smart meter, it should go through in the next couple hours. But I just need to sort of warn you and let you know if there is any issues and it hasn't come back. It may take up to 24 to 48 hours, but I'm doing it for you now as quickly as possible. So it should be done in the next couple of hours. So what I'll do is I'll just raise it for you now, the reconnection. There is one invoice that was sent out to you recently as well. That's you on the 30th of May, next week, Tuesday. Will you be alright to pay that one by that due date as well? Yeah, yeah. Because I just got it from holiday. Oh, okay. No worries. That's all good. Yeah, I'm just going to reset the reconnection for you now as to be today. I'll do it for around 12. There we go. Great, that one's been put through for you now as quickly as possible. And then, yeah, just ensure that in future that you, yeah, just let us know if you're going to be going away somewhere or you need a bit of time to pay your invoices. And then that way you can sort of avoid any sort of future disconnections. Did you want to go through your Victorian payment difficulty or financial assistance entitlements at all today, Powell? Pardon? Did you want to discuss your payment difficulty or financial assistance entitlements today? No, no, no. No? That's all been set up for you there. So just try to turn the main switch after you don't see a display on the meter itself. So just try to switch it back on after a couple hours in the afternoon and then that should be fine. You'll have power back on. Yeah. Thank you. No, thanks for your time. Have a great day. Thank you. Bye. Thank you. Yeah, bye.
