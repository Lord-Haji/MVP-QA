Best Energy through to Pooja, how can I help? Hi there, my name's Ben Bowery. I'm actually in hospital at the moment so I'm just trying to catch up on my emails and I know that our electricity is behind. I did sort out a payment plan but I think I'm about two weeks behind. I wanted to follow that up, I'm feeling a bit better. So what do you need from me? Right, so before we go ahead to discuss anything with you, I just need to let you know that this call will be recorded for coaching and quality purposes. I hope that's okay with you? Not a problem at all, yeah. Right, needed you to confirm your full name, date of birth and the property address please. Sure, it's Benjamin Emmanuel Lowry, 6th of April, 67 and 24 Moffat Place, Eden Slanning. Thank you so much. Right. Can I also have the state and the postcode Ben? Queensland 4207. Thank you. So you've got a total balance of $1,352.84 out of which $935 is outstanding. The last payment was made on 5th of May for $100 and because of a few inconsistencies in your payment plan, your payment plan broke. What do you wish to do going forward? Oh, I'd like to catch up on those payments and yeah, continue on if possible. Okay, cool. So are you able to catch up on them today by making the payment or not? Yeah, how much would that be? I think you have missed two payments, haven't you? Yeah, that's what I thought too. But yeah, I can pay that right now. Okay, so let's take a payment from you for $200 and then I'm happy to reset the arrangement. Okay, sorry, I've been in hospital three weeks. Yeah. I hope you're better now. I still have to have some biopsies done on my lungs. So hopefully it's fungal and not cancerous yet. Yeah, yeah, now good luck with that. Yeah, thank you. And I hope you get the strength to go through the biopsy. Yeah. Okay, Ben, I will be pausing the call recording quickly. Okay, so thank you so much for that, Ben. I'm sending the receipt to your e-mail address. Yeah. I have, give me a minute. Something is wrong with the system. It's taking forever for the e-mail address to load. Sorry, I won't be long. Almost finished now, Michael. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, carry on. Sorry, I've got this coming in. It's okay. It looks like our system is down. Oh, my God. The payment did go through, so that is a good thing, Ben. Yeah. However, the portal that we work on is, it just keeps buffering. I'm not able to navigate. Oh, okay. And everyone is having the same issue. I'm having messages from my team members saying that they're having the same issue. Oh, okay. God. Ben, are you free for the rest of the day? Can I call you back? Yeah, absolutely. I can give you the receipt number, and if you can give me your e-mail address, actually, I can e-mail it to you. So what is your e-mail address? Okay, wonderful. Yeah, benlowry, L-O-W-E-R-Y, 888 at gmail.com. Okay, let me reconfirm that. So benlowry at, sorry, benlowry, 888 at gmail.com. Correct, yes. All right, I have sent an e-mail. Can you just confirm if you have received it? Okay. Sure. Okay, awesome. So let me call you back because I'm unable to help you because of the system issue. Yeah, not a worry. I will call you back on the same number. Okay, wonderful. Awesome, thank you. Okay, thank you. Bye. Thanks, Ben.
