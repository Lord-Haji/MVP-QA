I see that one of the people I've called of late have seemingly signed me up and given me an account number. I didn't agree to it and I haven't agreed to it, but I've got an email with an offer. Let's have a look. I've got the account loading up with your phone number, so can I get you to say your full name and date of birth? Rodney Philip Mason, 1010 53. And your address? 21 Ranch Road, Tawonga South. Perfect. I can confirm there is an electricity account that has been set up. It's still in the cooling off period, so the transfer hasn't occurred yet. It's still with your current retailer. With that welcome pack or letter that you've received, have you had a look at the rates to see how they compare with your current retailer? So who was cheaper? Well, there's two rates there. I'm looking at it on my phone, the offer. Yeah. Dollar 29.8 per day. Yeah, that's okay. I've got our rates here. Do you have your current retailer's rates? I do and they're less than what? So your current one is cheaper. Well, we've got your electricity charges at May 15th, 2023. Your electricity charges as at May 15 after your 25% guaranteed discount on usage charges. So your current retailer's giving you 25%? No, this is what your offer is. Oh, yeah, that's okay. I've got our offer in front of me. What are your current retailer's rates and offer? Look, I'm not allowed to feed in here and I think it's a grid issue. I was told by the person who solicited my information that you would pay me $0.10 a kilowatt hour for feeding, but I'm not entirely sure that that's going to be acceptable with the grid. The reason I understood that I couldn't feed in is the grid stability was too much solar and so new customers aren't allowed to feed in in this area. You're offering $5.2 and I was told $0.10. So it's not what I was told. Okay. So hence, I'm not very happy with it. Okay. So that's fine. I can cancel it for you. So it'll just remain with your current retailer. So the transfer hasn't taken effect. Yeah, I'm not going to cancel it for you. I'm just going to keep it for you. It was just an electricity account from what I can see here. No gas was set up with us. No. All right. That's fine. That's all cancelled out. All good to go. Okay. Thank you. You might give some feedback to the person that recommended this or the group. Because they were flat out lying to me. Okay. I'll definitely pass that feedback on board and I do apologize about any inconveniences, but that has all been cancelled out. So all good to go. Okay. Thank you. That's okay. Have a nice day. You too. Bye. Bye.
