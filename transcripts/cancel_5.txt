I decided against it because I'm looking for somebody to cover electricity and gas. OK, what's that? Are you in? So far. OK, yeah, no, we definitely don't need gas there. Um, what's the account number? I don't know. I haven't got it off there. Oh, didn't you get a welcome pack? Yeah, I have, but I don't know where I put it. Right. Um, let me have a look. Can't you just type your name and address? Yeah, I have tried that. Um, maybe just a second there. I just need to use a different database. Donna Daly, D-O-L-E-Y. D-O-L-E-Y. Yeah. And can I have your full name? Oh, sorry, just your address and date of birth, please. My address is Unit 14, Stoke, 18 Crowders Road, Ellermoor Vale. Yeah. And the date of birth is the 26th of August, 1957. Excuse me. Um, cool. Um, all right, well, I'll cancel that for you and you'll stay with your current retailer, OK? All right, thanks. Thanks a lot. That's OK, no worries. Bye. See ya.
