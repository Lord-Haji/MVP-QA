This call is being recorded. If you do not wish to be recorded, please disconnect at this time. First Energy, Håkon Håk. Hi, this is Shea from Customer Care. I just have a customer on the line that needs to be transferred over to you. Yeah, what's the customer number, please? 322826. 322826. That's for Marcus. Yep. Fully ID'd? Yes, fully ID'd. And what does he want? He is inquiring about a... apparently being on a higher than expected billing plan. Okay, no problem. Put them through. No worries. Hi, good afternoon. Welcome to First Energy. My name is Varun. And this is Marcus. Yeah. So, the first thing I'll check, please. Yeah, about my pay. Your phone now. I'll just enter your phone number. Alright, bear with me for a moment. Now, as I mentioned, calls are recorded for quality and compliance purposes, Marcus. So, my colleague just mentioned that he would like to see if there is any better plan. Yeah. Yeah, because when I checked Energy Victoria, it stated that I'm not on the best plan. Okay, yeah. No problem. Give me one moment. There's only a quote here. We have not found it yet. We have not found it yet. Nothing is in the plan yet. It's right there. Oh, yeah. So, there is a plan which is called First Saver. Now, instead of 10% guaranteed discount which you're getting now, on the new plan, you will get 23% guaranteed discount. Okay. Move me to it. Yeah, okay. Give me... Why... when was this... Actually, I moved from HGL and I don't think you're... Basically, I'm just paying the same. You moved to First Energy in the month of January. Yeah, and I'm paying the same, basically. Same as HGL. Okay, well, if your usage is the same or maybe a little more, then you're not on the best plan. If your usage is the same or maybe a little more, then obviously you'll be paying the same amount. Whatever. Anyway, if you can move me to the new one, that would be great. Thank you. Yeah, okay. Now, even if... Can you reply from my end? Yeah, so even if we are changing the plan in Victoria for the compliance purposes, I have to read out the whole terms and conditions again. Okay. So I will try to do that as early as I can. Just bear with me. All right. In the meanwhile, I'm just going to ask you a few questions and then we can get it done. Now, are you the primary account holder authorized to enter this contract? For example, your name is currently on the energy bills. Yes. Any kind of medical equipment at the property for life support? No. Any kind of compression cards? No. Okay. Any solar panels at the property? No. Not solar yet. Solar, yes. Okay. Bear with me. All right. Now, based on the information you have provided and as per the assessment, we'll put you on the first saver product. Now, basically, that is the new plan on the system, which is just started a few days ago. So we'll put you on that plan. The new plan will offer you 23% guaranteed discount instead of 10% what you're getting now. Now, based on the information you have provided and as per the assessment, we can offer you the first saver product and I will provide you some information now so that you can make a comparison against the Victorian default offer and understand how much your discount is. Now, all amounts quoted are inclusive of GST. We can offer you the first saver product for your electricity. Can you tell me that? Sorry? Okay. No worries. I was standing here asking you whether you need to tell me that. I don't mind if you don't tell me. But it's fine. No, but just for compliance purposes, I have to read it. No. No worries. Okay. Now, all amounts quoted are inclusive of GST. We can offer you the first saver product for your electricity, $130 less than the current Victorian default offer that is also available from First Energy. Now, based on an annual small user reference consumption of 2,400 kilowatt hours per year, the estimated value of your electricity supply before any beyond-time discount would be $814 and the guaranteed discount is estimated at $126. Now, the key terms and conditions of our first saver product is a market retail contract with ongoing benefits. No fixed term and no exit fee for the supply of electricity with First Energy, which comes with a 23% guaranteed discount on the usage charges only. Now, do you also want to hear your new rates over the phone or you're happy to get them in your welcome pack? No, that's fine. Thank you. All good. Okay. Now, currently I see you get your bills and communications sent out every month. Are you happy with the monthly bills? Yes. And you're happy with bills sent via email as well, yeah? Correct. Okay. No problem. Now, this is a question for you. I just need a yes or no as an answer from your side. Would you like to proceed with entering into a contract with First Energy as your new energy retailer and understand this is not a request for information only, just a yes or no? Yes. That's great. Now, in order to transfer you to the new plan, I'm just going to confirm the details we already have here on the system. So your first name is Marcus, M-A-R-C-U-S. Correct. And your last name?
