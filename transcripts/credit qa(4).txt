Hello. Hi, can I speak with Nikki? This is her. Hi, Nikki. My name's Kate. I'm calling from First Energy. How are you going? Good, thank you. That's good. Just before we get into the call, I do just have to let you know the call may be monitored and recorded for quality and coaching purposes. The call is just in relation to the business account. If I could just grab your full name, the business name and your date of birth for security. Nikki Anne Hearn, AC1134. What else did you want, sorry? The name of the business. Cover Up Linen. But we do have it under something else here. Are you sure? That's my business. I don't have anything else. Yeah. No, I'm going to be able to grab your email address. Hang on. I'm going to email, excuse me, under anything else. It's under the trustee of Cover Up Linen. Yeah, one more word. Ptyt LTE, trustee. Sorry. Can I grab your email address? I'll get that from the email. The trustee for Cover Up Linen Trust. Thank you so much. So we've just been giving you a call in relation to this account. It's coming up for disconnection for non-payment as of $795.59. Outstanding on it? Yeah, I've been trying to, I've actually done it twice, called and put a, like pressed a button to have a call back and haven't had a call back. So I've been trying to call someone to see if I can get, like do a payment plan. So what's the reason for it being so behind at the moment? Honestly, I couldn't tell you because I've been paying 150 a week, so clearly that's not covering it. Okay, let's see what your usage is. Yeah, I just looked at the bill. So is it billed monthly? I believe so. Yeah. So let's have a look. On a fortnightly basis, you're using $160 worth of power. Exactly. So that's why the bill isn't coming down and it's climbing. So if we were to put you back on a payment plan, we would need around $250 a fortnight. $250 a fortnight. Yeah, okay, so I'm, what am I paying weekly now? Sorry. Like you're paying 150 a fortnight now. A fortnight? Seriously? Not a week? I'm trying to have a look, sorry. My computer's very slow and the payment plan that was previously set up was fortnightly. So, yep, it looks like it's coming in fortnightly. $150 fortnightly is what you've been paying. That's fucking why I'm behind then because I thought I had it set up weekly, sorry. So would you be able to do $150 weekly then? Yeah. Or would $300 fortnightly work be easier for you? We'll do it weekly. Honestly, my cash flow is pretty shit with my customers not paying weekly, so. Okay, yeah, so I can change that now to weekly. So it's just come out today 150. So if I do it on a Friday. You haven't received that, yep. So maybe we'll put it for Monday. Oh, no, so payment date 22nd of May. Yeah, which is Monday. Yeah, okay. Well, that doesn't make sense. I don't know because we're in upcoming, sorry. You're all good. The last payment we received out of your account was on the 9th, so actually it usually comes in on a Tuesday. Yeah, okay, so I might change that to a Friday then, every Friday. Which Friday was that that you'd like it? I'll start next Friday, so it'll come out on Monday, the 150. No, I've just cancelled that. Fucking hell, Mickey. I'll start it from this Friday, so I'll do 150 today, and then every Friday from that it will be 150. Yep, okay. And you just set it up via your BPAY, is that correct? Yep, I'm just doing it right now. Yep, amazing. Alrighty, so just so you're aware, our payment plans, they go for three months, and then we will be trying to get in touch with you to reset it. Please do get in touch with us if you miss our calls or anything. I know you said you tried. Apologies, we have been exceptionally busy this week. I just want to say, sorry, hon, can I just put my number on and not my husband's because he doesn't have time to answer the phone for our business because he works outside at another place. So I know that they've been contacting him. If I can put my phone number as the main contact. Yep. Let me just have a look. Would it be okay if we took Daniel's number off his, put you as the head person, but could put his number under the trustee, like the organisation's name, so it's like a last minute, we would only call him if we couldn't get in touch with you? Yep, that would be perfect. Yep. Let me do that. 150, electricity, repairing. Okay. Yep. Alrighty. Yep. I've got all of that updated there for Daniel. So his number isn't attached to his name anymore. It's only attached to the business, but we will always call a person with the number attached first, being yourself, and then we'll go to the next number. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. No worries. And we've got that whole payment plan set up for $150 weekly starting today. Besides that, was there anything else I could help you with? No, that's all. Thank you. No worries. Thanks for your time and I hope you have a great day. Thank you. You too. Bye. Bye.
