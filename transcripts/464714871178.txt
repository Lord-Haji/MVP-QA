But then, okay, it has not gone through, it might come back to you, to his account. Okay. Yeah, it generally, it should. So the invoice, let me just, yeah, just, I'll quickly finish the call. Yeah. So the invoice will have a biller code and the reference number it should have with your account. It has to be number two at the end. So it's 3189032. So if he has done that, it should go through.

So just ring him if it hasn't come and I'll have a look at the invoice and make sure he knows about that. Because he may. Yeah, I will add an alert to the account to contact him for future references. Yeah. Do people, other people have problems with this? Some of them, because it's generally on the first page. If you go through the invoice, the first page has actually got all the details. Down there, it's how to make payments, different options, Australia Post or BPAY or even direct debit setup.
