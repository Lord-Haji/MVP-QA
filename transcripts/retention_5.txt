Oh hi Satish here from First Energy. Oh hi thanks for calling back. Yeah that's ok, we're finished for the day so there's no more calls, I'll get us sorted. Just to advise you, the calls were called for Quality and Compliance Devices. I'll just quickly ID and I'll get us sorted, I've actually got a good answer for you. Can I just confirm your full name, address and date of birth there please? Yeah, Bruce Milne, 42 Oram Crescent Ringwood North, Victoria 3134 and 281254. Excellent, what I'm also going to do as well, I'm going to send you a 6 digit code so you don't have to give me your ID. I've actually got some good news for you, the new plan is actually cheaper, it's like another 13% and since your bills are quite high, I don't think it's worth staying on your plan because that $100 will get eaten up. You're better off going on the higher discount. Ok, excellent. Yeah, that's ok. I thought I'd better check it first, I don't like changing your plans and it doesn't work out for you. So just check your phone, I'll just send you a 6 digit code if you can get that back to me. Ok. And while I've got you here, quick question, Bruce, do you classify yourself as a small, medium or large user? That's all I need to know. Oh, look I think we're probably medium, I suppose medium to high, even though there's only two of us we tend to use a bit. Yeah, no it doesn't affect the price, it's just the scripting I have to read out to you. So has that code come through yet? Yep, 594 939. Yeah, so that's all. So when I read the scripting out in a few minutes, I won't ask you for your ID because you've already given me that code. So stay there, I'll get my scripting ready, I might as well get it done because I don't want you waiting and then I get busy and miss your call, it won't take long. Ok, thanks. Yeah, that's ok. So is this a simpler plan, like there's no sort of discounts or no, it's just a discount, there's no bonuses and stuff? Yeah, so on this plan it's just a straight flat 23% guaranteed discount off the rates. Ok, excellent. Yeah, we shall work out better for you. And if I become a low, you know, you had to get a pension card or whatever? Yep, hold on, straight away, we can get it back then if we... Ok, and just stay on the same plan again, yeah. Yeah, and you get that concession card, I think like an extra 17% discount in Victoria, that's what I was asking you. Wow. So as soon as you get it, you'll remember, most customers like you, as soon as they get in the mail, they'll just remind you, call everyone. But they don't tell you. I think on the welcome packet it tells you that you can get buses and trams and electricity but no one ever tells you. So just make a mental note, as soon as you get it, just call us and say, hey, this is Bruce, I want to add the card. Give us a start there because I think we can actually get it manually backdated for you as well. So say you get the card and say you call us in August, which your card date is May or June, we can backdate it to the start date as well. Ok, excellent. So Bruce, can I start bringing the scripting up to you? Yeah, sure, that'd be great. Thanks. So like I said, my name's Satish from First Energy. Just letting you know, this call is being recorded for quality and compliance purposes. Before we proceed, can you confirm, do you have any types of medical equipment at your property for life support? No. Excellent. Now Bruce, based on the information you provided in our assessment, we can offer you the first saver product and I'll provide some information so you can make a comparison against the Victorian default offer and understand how much your discount is. All amounts quoted are inclusive of GST. We can offer you the first saver product for your electricity, which is $207 less than the current Victorian default offer that is also available from First Energy. Based on annual medium user reference consumption of 4000 kWh, the estimated value of your electricity supply before any pay on time discount will be $1362. The guaranteed discount is estimated at $265. All amounts quoted are inclusive of GST. Now Bruce, would you like to hear your rates now? Um, yeah, OK, thanks. So remember, when you bill you've got the two blocks, the block one and block two. So the first, 11.178, is called step one and then anything over there is classified as step two. So your new rate now for the block one, oh wow that's a big drop, is now going to be $22.191 a kWh. And your block two, 30.58 minus 23%, block two drops down to $23.546 a kWh. And the daily supply charge is the same of $1.29.18 today. Bruce, I'll also advise you, your rates will be set out in your welcome pack for your review. So after this call, when I key in, I'll get the system to send it out to you so you can check it all, OK? OK. Now, what was the 11.178 that you mentioned? What was that? Sorry? I thought before you gave me the rate of 22, I thought you said something about 11.178. Oh no. OK, I must have misunderstood. That's OK. So what I read out to you earlier, is I said that we have to give you an estimator figure of your medium usage. Yeah. Now, no, that 11.178, that's your usage. So you have two blocks. So once you use 11.178, that's block one. Once you go over, it's on your bill. OK, that's what it was. Yeah. Now, the key terms and conditions of our first-ever product is a market retail contract with ongoing benefits, no fixed term and no exit fee, full supply of electricity with First Energy, which comes with a 23% guaranteed discount off your electricity usage charges. And that is for the NMI 630-52927516 for the address of 42 Oram Crescent, Ringwood North, Victoria, 3134. Now, there's no solar. Now, would you like to receive your bill and other communications from First Energy by email or post? Email is fine, yeah. I've got bdmsnnn at billhero.com.au. Is that correct? That's correct, yeah. Yeah. Thanks, Bruce. First Energy will send you a monthly bill by email and send you any notices and communications electronically. And, Bruce, if we need to post anything up to you, I've just got to check. Yeah, unfortunately, Victoria, I just have to ask you all these questions. So bear with me. Just a legal requirement. Oh, yep. Can I just confirm, 42 Oram Crescent, Ringwood North, Victoria, 3134 is your best postal address? Yes, that's correct, yeah. And like I said, since you confirmed your email address earlier, First Energy will send you a monthly bill by email and send you any notices and communications electronically. So, so far, do you have any questions? Do they round the bill or how do they work out the bill? Excuse me? Is the bill exact each month or do they round it or round it out? No, no. What happens is you've got a smart meter, so every one or two hours, you can check it on your phone. It sends us a read and at the end of the month, we bill you automatically. So it's all actual readings. There's no estimates on that front. That's fine. Now, on this question, I need a clear yes or no and we're halfway there. Would you like to proceed with entering into a contract with First Energy as your new energy retailer and understand this is not a request for information only? Yes. Yeah, okay. That's great. So in order to transfer you into a contract, I'm confirming your full name is Bruce Mill and I'll go back to my system. Two things I need to confirm with you. 28th of December, 1954 is your date of birth. Is that correct? Yes. And 0413 00 9905 is your best contact number. Is that correct? Yes. Okay, you gave me the six-digit code so you don't have to give me your driver's license or Medicare. So that part is done. Okay. Okay, we're halfway there.
